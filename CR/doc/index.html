                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some clarifications:
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (In reply to comment #17)
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (In reply to comment #15)
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also this site:
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://metavid.org/w/index.php?title=Stream:senate_proceeding_02-04-11/0:00:25/0:01:45&amp;tl=1
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This again seems to just be one media file with jumping to different segments.
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You wouldn't want to replace the URL on the fly, that would trigger a file
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reload each time.
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No it doesn't. Browsers have stopped reloading resources where just the
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fragment is changed and not the actual resource URL. The way in which media
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fragment URIs are specified plays with that fact, too. Unless the resource
                  has
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expired, it will only request the appropriate byte ranges for the time range
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specified in the URL. 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; Which browsers? Is the special-casing when the src attribute is set, or is it
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; part of the resource selection algorithm (which is run asynchronously as a
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; result of setting src)?
                  &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; I was talking generally - when you change the fragment on a Web page in the URL
                  &gt; &gt; bar, the Web page is not reloaded any more, but only the fragment offset is
                  &gt; &gt; changed.
                  &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; As for video, there is no implementation yet, so of course I'm not referring to
                  &gt; &gt; implemented cases there. But the way in which media fragment URIs are specified
                  &gt; &gt; implies that if the browser has setup information about the resource (i.e.
                  &gt; &gt; metadata loaded), then it will use that for further fragment retrieval actions.
                  &gt; &gt; So, basically it works like setting the currentTime to a different location on
                  &gt; &gt; the same resource. I think that would be outside the resource selection
                  &gt; &gt; algorithm, which would not be re-run for a change of fragment unless the
                  &gt; &gt; resource has expired in the meantime.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; That might be the intention, but if we want changes of src that only change the
                  &gt; fragment component to be handled differently, it has to be in the HTML spec. If
                  &gt; not, it will be treated as any other change of the src attribute and cause all
                  &gt; state to be reset and fetching/decoding to start over. (Currently even setting
                  &gt; v.src=v.src isn't handled, it would be similar to calling load().)
                  
                  OK, well this is a problem with just start time offsets, too. I've registered a new
                  bug for this over in bug 12643.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  I would recommend the following approaches:
                  
                  * Don't allow people to upload content that isn't in the well-supported format(s).
                  
                  * If you really must, then first, realise that this is not what the feature was designed
                  for. But then, use script to detect the error condition (using the onerror handler
                  on &lt;video&gt; or &lt;source&gt; depending on what you're doing) and then in that handler, replace
                  the &lt;video&gt; element with the plugin.
                  
                  * Alternatively, use &lt;video&gt; as the fallback to the plugin, instead of the plugin
                  as the fallback to the &lt;video&gt;.
                  
                  Also, always provide the download link, don't hide it in the fallback.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: It's not so much that it can't contain headings, so much as it has to only
                  contain phrasing content, much like &lt;legend&gt; or &lt;p&gt;, or, indeed, &lt;h1&gt;. 
                  
                  In the example given, you can just use &lt;details&gt; as is. Just style it to look like
                  in the mockup using CSS. It's all semantically fine, because the whole point of &lt;summary&gt;
                  is that it's the "heading" for the contents of the &lt;details&gt;. :-)
                  
                  (It's a little suboptimal in that really &lt;details&gt; should be used to hide stuff that
                  is summarised in &lt;summary&gt;, not to create a section that can be closed, the latter
                  is really more presentation. But that's somewhat splitting hairs.)

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: Opera and Chrome do what the spec says. Safari and IE seem to just not
                  allow innerHTML to change on &lt;head&gt;. Based on this, I haven't changed the spec here.
                  
                  I also had trouble finding the problem on the snapple.com site. Could you be more
                  specific about how to reproduce the bug? Why does the page not break in Chrome or
                  Opera?

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: &lt;details open&gt; is specifically designed to test how DOM-mutating features
                  work in practice, so that we can learn from it, and apply those lessons with future
                  features. The .defaultValue design of &lt;input&gt; has been widely criticised but we don't
                  have good information on whether or not the alternative is actually better, and &lt;details&gt;
                  is a good way to test it.

                  Status: Rejected.
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: In response to another bug I made it clear that the date picker doesn't
                  need to expose the ISO date format, since that has been a source of confusion. I haven't
                  seen confusion about the other point.
                  
                  See comment 1, though. While implementations are still new, I think we should avoid
                  having examples. However, if people want examples, and can provide images that show
                  excellent designs (and that would thus at least bias implementations in a positive
                  way), reopen the bug and I'll add them. I'm no UI guy. Marking NEEDSINFO since we
                  need images to proceed.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  often times (at least I have wanted it wherever I have seen it)
                  for a given type of data, there is a need for major and minor tic marks to be in a
                  range control.  this isn't always there, depending on the browser.  this would
                  - make sure that major and minor tic marks would be displayed if enabled regardless
                  of browser
                  - ensure conformity to a specification instead of everybody doing it their own way
                  - I forgot my other point
                  
                  min, max, and step is not enough for proper display of data.  NOBODY likes to see
                  a slider control without proper tic marks.  have you seen a ruler without proper tic
                  marks?  what does a ruler look like?  there are major and minor tic marks.  people
                  expect to see the same thing with their data.  major tic marks at 10's, minor at 5's.
                  major at 30.0's, minor at 10.0's.  I think you get the drift.  data must have semantics
                  to it to be readable. you don't have to display the numbers, although that would be
                  a REALLY NICE to have and meaningful on the majors.  personally I think numbers should
                  also be an option to add to the spec (the HTML author may find that there is not room
                  enough to display the numbers).
                  
                  why don't you ask yourself the reasons for having this feature in a browser control?
                  
                  have you ever seen a micrometer or I think it was a vernier in college?  tic marks,
                  major and minor.  pick one up or a ruler for a buck.
                  
                  you just choose one of the tic mark specs.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: Support for keywords to reference specific things, e.g. gestures or special
                  keys (like F1), is something that is intentionally left open for a future version,
                  but before we go there we really need more experience with the changes we've done
                  so far.

                  Check-in comment: make .action and .formAction handle the empty string more like the
                  content attribute gets processed, for sanity (even though that value is technically
                  not valid anyway)

                  &gt; It has only partially addressed...it's still very ambiguous. 
                  
                  It is not ambiguous.  The HTML sectioning algorithm is stated precisely and explicitly
                  in the spec:
                  
                  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#outlines
                  
                  If you believe any part of that section of the spec is ambiguous, please say exactly
                  which part.  It tells you exactly what the semantics of all the heading elements are.
                  (Of course, it's hard to follow, but you can't demand something that's both completely
                  precise *and* easy to follow.)

                  What 10-years-old browsers to should not affect what the specification allows. If
                  you find your clients need HTML from the nineties, use HTML from the nineties: HTML4
                  or HTML3.2, rather than HTML5. Nobody is forcing you to use HTML5.

                  Rationale: In practice, things are rather more complicated. Quota could be hit unexpectedly,
                  or could be applied by the user at the user's whim. Or it could be that the quota
                  wasn't going to be exceeded, but the UA prompted the user to let the user know the
                  limit was being reached, and the user decided to deny more quota to the site.
                  
                  What we need here is implementation experience to learn what the typical authoring
                  patterns are, what the possible user interfaces are, and so on, before we add more
                  standard features in this area.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The comments in that WebKit bug seem very confused. Note that once you
                  pass a &lt;select&gt; tag you're no longer "in body", you're "in select", and things parse
                  very differently there. As far as I can tell, the spec is correct. If it's not, then
                  please indicate a specific HTML fragment that you think parses differently than it
                  should.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Standardisation is the last step one takes to do this kind of thing.
                  
                  First, you need to research the use cases and requirements by discussing the issue
                  with authors and implementors, on a public list (e.g. public-html@w3.org).
                  
                  Then you need to come up with a clear description of the problem that needs to be
                  solved, including any security issues. (For example, your description above doesn't
                  discuss the problem of whether a Comcast customer should have his Comcast set-top
                  box accessible to http://attacker.evil.example/, or whether only comcast.com should
                  have access to it.)
                  
                  Then, you discuss your problem proposal with authors and implementors. Read the responses.
                  Listen to the feedback. Consider whether your ideas are good solutions to the use
                  cases and requirements put forward. Discussions here should be done in public, e.g.
                  on an archived public mailing list or documented in blogs.
                  
                  Once the problem is well-established, you get implementors to commit to implementing
                  the feature. If you can't get several implementors to implement the feature, then
                  get at least one user agent to implement it experimentally. Experimental implementations
                  should be publicly available.
                  
                  Only once you have experimental implementations or a number of committed implementors,
                  as well as a clear problem description, is it appropriate to consider the issue for
                  standardisation. Even then, you will need to document the experience found from any
                  implementations, the use cases and requirements that were found in the first step,
                  the data that the design was based on, and so forth, as well as demonstrate the importance
                  of the problem, and demonstrate that the solution is one that will be used correctly
                  and widely enough for it to solve the stated problem.
                  
                  Typically at this step the original design gets thrown out and a significantly better
                  design is developed, informed by the previous research, new research, and implementation
                  and author experience with experimental implementations. Sometimes, the idea is abandoned
                  at this stage. Only after this is the spec updated.

                  Thanks for considering this.  One thing I wanted to clarify though,
                  
                  &gt;If this is a problem in practice, authors are
                  &gt;encouraged to add something to the form after everything else has been added,
                  &gt;marking the form as complete, and having server-side scripts check that the
                  &gt;client only sent complete forms.
                  
                  That's exactly the situation - typically the server side sees that the form is
                  incomplete and so throws up an error page.  The user (if they understand what
                  happened) must go back to the page with the form, wait for the whole form to
                  download this time, and then resubmit.  It would be a smoother user experience
                  if the form were not submitted until it's complete (by some measure).
                  
                  It's unfortunate that HTML doesn't have any way to mark the end of a form or the
                  point when it is complete and submittable (without resorting to Javascript).  The
                  closing &lt;/form&gt; tag no longer indicates that, although it did in earlier versions.
                  Perhaps some future revision to HTML will include an explicit end-of-form marker.
                  Until then, I guess a workaround is to always put the textfield as the final
                  element of the form, so that it can't accidentally be submitted too soon.

                  If you are asking what event fires when a user chooses something in from a &lt;datalist&gt;
                  to use in an &lt;input type=text&gt;, then: the 'input' event (oninput="") fires when the
                  user makes the selection, and the 'change' event (onchange="") fires when the user
                  leaves the control.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The only value you can see from .compatMode is "CSS1Compat". If you ever
                  find your document is in "quirks" mode or "limited quirks" mode, that means your document
                  is in some way non-conforming (e.g. you forgot your DOCTYPE). The .compatMode feature
                  is only specified for compatibility with legacy content; there is, as far as I can
                  tell, no use case for this feature in practice. I highly recommend pretending that
                  the .compatMode feature doesn't exist.
                  
                  I have therefore not made a change to the specification. I considered adding a note,
                  but I couldn't work out what a note would say that would be helpful. As Ms2ger points
                  out in earlier comments, the spec already seems to include all the information you
                  requested.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  &gt; As for multiple interpretations, it is obvious to the most naive
                  reader that
                  &gt; both consequents may apply simultaneously, e.g., both of the following may be
                  &gt; true:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; * One byte in the range FE to FF
                  &gt;     -&gt; The whole sequence must be replaced by a single U+FFFD REPLACEMENT
                  &gt; CHARACTER.
                  &gt; * One byte in the range 80 to BF not preceded by a byte in the range 80 to FD
                  &gt;     -&gt; Each byte must be replaced with a U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; In this case, which of the two consequents apply? You may say the first? Why is
                  &gt; that? Why not the second? Since you have not bothered to explain this syntax,
                  &gt; either interpretation is valid.
                  
                  Yes, either is valid. They have exactly the same effect, so it doesn't matter.

                  is a non-starter and as such I don't see any value in defining this particular typographic
                  convention.

                  &gt; The IANA character set registry is what the rest of the Internet uses.
                  
                  That's not at all clear. In particular, comment 6 suggests it's not what browser vendors
                  use, which is the target audience of the requirement in question.
                  
                  
                  &gt; If you believe it is incomplete, feel free to augment it.
                  
                  I'm happy for the IANA character set registry to be updated, but whether I do it,
                  or you do it, or someone else does it, or nobody does it, it doesn't change what the
                  HTML spec needs to say.
                  
                  
                  &gt; It would be satisfactory to
                  &gt; me if the HTML specification decided to define it (as long as the specification
                  &gt; is sufficiently precise for interoperability and it can be used as the
                  &gt; reference for the IANA registry).
                  
                  The HTML spec references a definition of Windows 949.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Choosing to specify behavior in terms of
                  &gt; some vendor-specific character set that is undefined actually *harms*
                  &gt; interoperability.
                  
                  It isn't undefined, just not registered.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Since I don't use Windows, how am I to know what byte
                  &gt; sequences are valid and what their meanings are in this mystery encoding?
                  
                  Look at its definition, cited in the HTML spec.
                  
                  
                  &gt; It
                  &gt; would be totally acceptable for me to simply define windows-949 as UTF-8, since
                  &gt; there is no other specification, and since it is otherwise undefined, I hereby
                  &gt; define it as such.
                  
                  There is another specification.

                  &gt; Looks like WebKit actually uses 1024 for the number of bytes to the _beginning_
                  &gt; of the &lt;meta&gt;, 
                  
                  Thanks for not following WebKit for beginning versus end of the meta.
                  
                  &gt; Re comment 6: Please consider this your first complaint, then. Blocking until
                  &gt; the first 1024 bytes have been seen without a timeout would mean that
                  &gt; hanging-GET style iframes would not fire anything until a kilobyte of data has
                  &gt; been received, which could result in several events getting eaten up.
                  
                  Only if hanging-get authors aren't competent enough to declare their encoding up front.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: (In reply to comment #0)
                  &gt; Because the XML serialization of HTML5 does not require or specify a DOCTYPE
                  &gt; (and therefore, a DTD), generic XML processing tools have no way of determining
                  &gt; the proper attribute to use as an ID.
                  
                  There are several ways for generic XML processing tools to know that the id="" attribute
                  on elements in the HTML, MathML, and SVG namespaces is an ID attribute. The tool can
                  have hardcoded namespace knowledge. The tool can be given a DTD. The tool can be given
                  an XML Schema. The tool can be configured with namespace-specific information.
                  
                  
                  &gt; This causes problems when using e.g.
                  &gt; XInclude with the "element" xpointer, which uses the ID to determine the
                  &gt; subtree to include.
                  
                  If the tool implements XInclude, it can also implement HTML (and MathML and SVG),
                  at least the minimum required for its users to use HTML (or MathML or SVG) with XInclude.
                  
                  
                  &gt; I use this currently to include relevant portions of XHTML
                  &gt; into an Atom feed, and it is broken with XHTML5.
                  
                  You can use an XPath XPointer in XInclude, instead of relying on IDness.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Currently, the specification is silent about whether xml:id is permitted at all
                  
                  That's out of scope of the HTML spec. Nothing stops you from using xml:id with HTML.
                  If you decide xml:id is a specification that applies to your stack, then it is conforming
                  in HTML for you.
                  
                  
                  &gt; and if so, what its interaction is with id.
                  
                  If there are any specific interactions that are not defined, that's an oversight.
                  The HTML spec, as far as I am aware, _does_ define the behaviour of its APIs with
                  respect to other features that introduce IDs (there are many more than just xml:id).
                  
                  
                  &gt; I suggest that xml:id be permitted
                  
                  That's up to you. Only you can decide what specs are in scope for your documents.
                  
                  
                  &gt; and be preferred over id for the XML serialization
                  
                  xml:id doesn't seem to do anything that the id="" attribute in HTML doesn't already
                  do, so recommending that people use it seems like a bad idea.
                  
                  
                  &gt; while being forbidden in the HTML serialization. 
                  
                  It's not forbidden, it's impossible.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Whatever the decision may be, please make it clear in
                  &gt; the text.
                  
                  It's not clear to me that there is any relevant decision to make clear in the spec.

                  &gt; I did not know about &amp;shy; but there is a problem, when it is entered as
                  &gt; "skum&amp;shy;tomte" one can not search for "skumtomte" within a document.
                  
                  That would be a browser bug, no?
                  
                  
                  &gt; Therefore I think that "skum&lt;wbr shy /&gt;tomte" or something like that would be
                  &gt; better,
                  
                  Why not just fix browsers so one can search across &amp;shy;?
                  
                  
                  &gt; Neverthe less I'll start using &amp;shy; from now on. Even tough browsers
                  &gt; could handle it a bit better (Should probably just be one line or two of code,
                  &gt; just make a copy of searchable text and remove &amp;shy; from it and from search
                  &gt; query, then perform regular search function. That's a one-liner :)
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Well,
                  &gt; Thank you Mr. Simon Pieters for informing me about the &amp;shy; entity.
                  
                  You changed resolution to NEEDSINFO. That state usually indicates that more information
                  is needed from the bug reporter. If you're happy with the spec as it is, WORKSFORME
                  is the right resolution. If you think the spec should be changed, REOPEN the bug.

                  Rationale: IIRC, we actually had it called &lt;navigation&gt; originally, and changed it
                  based on feedback that it was too long. As others have pointed out, it actually is
                  consistent with the style used by HTML (insofar as there is a style). If anything,
                  the exception is &lt;blockquote&gt;.

                  it is not obvious that tbody is a row grouping element.  by its name I assume this
                  is a container for the whole body of all the tr and td elements collectively, just
                  as the body element contains the content of the page.
                  
                  but I am suggesting something where I could, in effect,
                  &lt;col style="font-weight:bold; background-color:red; color:white; border-color-left:brown;
                  border-style-left:solid; border-width-left:thin; border-style-right:none; font-family:Verdana;
                  text-wrap:none; text-decoration:line-through; vertical-align:top; text-align:right;"&gt;
                  
                  CSS like this.  generic stuff that people use everyday in formatting text.  this is
                  what needs to be applied to col, colgroup.
                  
                  unfortunately, this will never be heard by the CSS folk because they don't listen,
                  so I give up.  I am closing this bug.

                  Status: Partially Accepted
                  Change Description: none
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  For popup blocking: agreed. I'm not sure we can do any more than we already have,
                  though. The spec doesn't actually require browsers to support popups at all.
                  
                  For back-button lock: not sure what this is referring to.
                  
                  For video: agreed on the full-screen thing; this will likely be handled in the CSSOM
                  spec.

                  &gt; &gt; (In reply to comment #33)
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;button role=button aria-pressed=true&gt; should not do anything different than
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;button aria-pressed=true&gt; according to the ARIA spec as far as I can tell
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; (that's what the "implicit semantics" stuff is all about!). If it does, ARIA
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; should be fixed.
                  &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; Ian, you're misunderstanding the role of ARIA in the DOM. Redundant ARIA is
                  &gt; &gt; really helpful for supporting existing ATs and it's quite handy for exposing
                  &gt; &gt; data easily with JS libraries.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Perhaps you've misunderstood what Ian is saying in your quotation.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Steve is saying that in current implementations, role="button" in that markup
                  &gt; is *not* redundant since you need it to make "aria-pressed" work. If you omit
                  &gt; role="button", then the button is not reported as pressed in the accessibility
                  &gt; tree. Ian is saying that it *should* work even if you omit role="button", since
                  &gt; ARIA allows host languages to define implicit ARIA semantics on elements and
                  &gt; attributes, and HTML5 defines button as having the implied semantic of role
                  &gt; button, so "aria-pressed" should apply to it the same way.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; So there's a question here about how ARIA annotations do and should behave
                  &gt; beyond the question of whether we should allow redundant markup.
                  
                  Hi ben, yes I am saying in the limited cases where an aria-* won't work without the
                  addition of a redundant role, the conformance rules should not disallow the role.
                  In all other cases the it should be disallowed.
                  
                  FYI
                  since this bug has been marked as wontfix I am working directly with mike smith to
                  work out which role/aria-* combinations need to be allowed to match implementations,
                  it is my understanding he will use this data to implement the conformance rules in
                  the W3C validator.

                  Rationale: We'll probably add a way to get image data straight from a same-origin
                  image in a future version (it's a little late in the cycle to add features right now),
                  so I've marked this LATER.
                  
                  In the meantime, though, why is "having to generate new canvases" a problem? It's
                  only five extra lines of code, which are easily put into a utility function and forgotten:
                  
                  image.onload = function()
                  {
                  var canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
                  canvas.width = image.width;
                  canvas.height = image.height;
                  var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
                  context.drawImage(image, 0, 0);
                  imageData = context.getImageData(0, 0, image.width, image.height);

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: It's not invalid. The spec doesn't say that &lt;figure&gt; must not be used for
                  inline figure, it just says that &lt;figure&gt; can be used for things that could be taken
                  out of flow. The only normative text is "The figure element represents some flow content,
                  optionally with a caption, that is self-contained and is typically referenced as a
                  single unit from the main flow of the document." (it's normative due to the definition
                  of the word "represents"), and that sentence is consistent with the usage above.

                  think it's perfectly reasonable to expect kiosks to be streaming videos for months
                  at a time, let alone more than 4 days, and one can totally imagine that in such a
                  scenario a script might be adding cues onto a video that is playing at a point longer
                  than 100 hours.

                  Rationale: "overlong" is the term that the UTF-8 spec (RFC3629) uses. Also, "non-shortest
                  form" is really stilted and reads poorly.

                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Section 4.10.7.1.14 (range state)
                  &gt; -Why doesn't the readonly attribute apply to the range state?
                  
                  Because only text fields have a concept of "readonly". UI widgets for range controls
                  do not (they can be disabled, but not left interactive but readonly -- if you think
                  about it, it makes no sense).
                  
                  
                  &gt; Section 4.10.7.1.15 (color state)
                  &gt; -It says "In this state, there is always a color picked, and there is no way to
                  &gt; set the value to the empty string." and "otherwise, set it to the string
                  &gt; "#000000""
                  &gt; This may be problematic because I can't differ between no color has been set
                  &gt; and black.
                  
                  There's no way to not have a color set. It's like a checkbox, which is either checked
                  or not, it can't not have a value at all, or a range control, whose pointer has to
                  point somewhere, it can't just not have a value.
                  
                  
                  &gt; -Related to the above the required attribute does not apply to the color state.
                  
                  Right, it's impossible to not set a value, so it's not necessary to say it's required.
                  
                  
                  &gt; -Also in the color state the readonly attribute doesn't apply. Why?
                  
                  It's not a text field, same as with type=range.

                  &gt; * It is slightly less verbose
                  
                  Minimally so, given that most people would probably end up using a &lt;span&gt; around the
                  main heading in order to get easier styling control.
                  
                  
                  &gt; * It is easier to style with CSS. &lt;hgroup&gt; requires detailed knowledge of the
                  &gt; markup structure whereas with &lt;subhead&gt; and a :heading(n) selector, one can do:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; :heading(n) {/*rules for the heading*/}
                  &gt; :heading(n) &gt; subhead {/*special rules for the subheading*/} 
                  
                  As opposed to:
                  
                  h1 { ... }
                  hgroup h2 { ... }
                  
                  ...this doesn't seem simpler.
                  
                  Also, I think it would probably end up being really:
                  
                  h1 span.main { ... }
                  h1 subheading { ... }
                  
                  ...vs:
                  
                  hgroup h1 { ... }
                  hgroup h2 { ... }
                  
                  ...which is at least a wash, if not more confusing, IMHO.
                  
                  
                  &gt; * It is semantically less confusing. There is no ambiguity about whether the
                  &gt; &lt;hgroup&gt; is the heading element or the child &lt;hx&gt;. That means it is more
                  &gt; obvious what a :heading selector will select, and more obvious how
                  &gt; accessibility APIs will map the various elements.
                  
                  I don't think this confusion exists with anyone except the spec weenies amongst us,
                  and the spec weenies will find the answer unambiguously in the spec.
                  
                  
                  &gt; * It arguably has better fallback semantically (if not visually, although that
                  &gt; is easier to fix using CSS; see above). A legacy UA will consider the whole
                  &gt; thing to be one heading rather than several headings with a
                  &gt; possibly-nonsensical parent-child relationship as in the &lt;hgroup&gt; case.
                  
                  I'm not sure the semantic fallback really matters. &lt;hgroup&gt; has significantly better
                  graceful degradation in real use cases, even without CSS.
                  
                  
                  &gt; * It preserves the invariant that all &lt;hx&gt; elements represent headings, which
                  &gt; may make certain tools easier to write. I also think it makes the outline
                  &gt; algorithm slightly easier to implement.
                  
                  The outline algorithm doesn't even mention &lt;hgroup&gt;, so I'm not sure it would make
                  much difference at all. The only complexity &lt;hgroup&gt; adds is in getting text out when
                  you need just a single string, and that is pretty minimal complexity, at least compared
                  to the outline algorithm.
                  
                  
                  &gt; * It seems harder to use incorrectly. The only obvious mistake that one could
                  &gt; make would be to use &lt;subhead&gt; outside a &lt;hx&gt; element which would be relatively
                  &gt; harmless (semantics of &lt;div&gt;).
                  
                  Given how &lt;h1&gt; is misused, I don't see any reason to think that misuse of any proposal
                  here would end up being appreciably worse.
                  
                  
                  &gt; The main disadvantages I can think of are:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; * It makes it slightly harder to determine the text of a heading (need to walk
                  &gt; the tree skipping &lt;subhead&gt; elements). On the other hand simple properties like
                  &gt; .textContent should be considered inadequate anyway since alt text should be
                  &gt; considered part of the heading text.
                  
                  It makes generic algorithms for grabbing text inadequate too. In fact, I'd say it
                  basically means you have the same complexity problem as &lt;hgroup&gt; mentioned earlier.
                  
                  
                  &gt; * Doesn't support the use case of multiple subheadings of different weights.
                  &gt; This seems like a very minor use case that could be addressed in the future if
                  &gt; it is significant.
                  
                  The spec itself in certain incarnations has three levels of headings, so wouldn't
                  be able to use this (but does use &lt;hgroup&gt;, at least when not published by the W3C).
                  
                  
                  (In reply to comment #5)
                  &gt; Educator perspective:
                  
                  Thanks for this, it's quite interesting information. Please continue to provide these
                  insights!
                  
                  
                  &gt; 3. I asked the following questions:
                  &gt; a. Does any pattern make immediate sense to you, i-e. would you intuitively
                  &gt; understand it even if it had not been explained?
                  &gt; Having h2 change its value depending on being inside hgroup (a) or position (b)
                  &gt; was generally confusing. No student liked this idea. It was considered an extra
                  &gt; threshold that would make HTML harder to learn.
                  
                  This is interesting, because it contradicts what we see in the wild: what people tend
                  to do when they have subheadings (assuming they use anything other than &lt;div&gt;s) is
                  use an &lt;h1&gt; immediately followed by an &lt;h2&gt;.
                  
                  
                  &gt; What I can say with certainty from my research is that elements should not
                  &gt; alter their meaning depending on position.
                  
                  Agreed, though I don't think the meaning of &lt;hx&gt; change with &lt;hgroup&gt;, at least not
                  at the level Web developers would look at it. They're still headings with different
                  "weights" (intentionally not using a term of art like "rank"). &lt;hgroup&gt; just groups
                  them together, like &lt;form&gt; does to a bunch of &lt;input&gt;s, or &lt;datalist&gt;, &lt;select&gt;, and
                  &lt;optgroup&gt; do (in various ways) to a bunch of &lt;option&gt;s.
                  
                  
                  &gt; I can also say with certainty, that my students all agreed that some kind of
                  &gt; wrapping was needed (c or d), otherwise the markup would be fragile.
                  
                  Option (a) presumably also addresses that need.
                  
                  
                  &gt; No student could immediately envision an UI or mechanism that would alleviate
                  &gt; such concerns. Having to educate customers was considered something they did
                  &gt; not look forward to doing.
                  
                  Well we can all empathise with that.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale:
                  
                  I don't really see what problem the proposals here solve. &lt;hgroup&gt; is unambiguous,
                  easy to style, has great graceful degradation, paves an existing cowpath (one in particular
                  widely used by the W3C's own documents), is not especially verbose, not especially
                  complicated... and it's documented in tutorials, and used by some newer sites. It's
                  not something that comes up all the time, so it's not something that must be understood
                  by new authors immediately, but when they do see it it's pretty self-explanatory,
                  and easily searched for ("hgroup" is not a common word like "subhead").
                  
                  We discussed the new sectioning elements years ago, shook out the obvious problems,
                  and now it's long past time to stop bikeshedding these decisions and just move on.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  If there was an API, I wouldn't have filed this bug.  :)  With DOM
                  Range, you should be able to emulate it pretty easily via deleteContents() and insertNode(),
                  although that's not specced and I haven't tried it.  But for textbox/input selections,
                  which are different because their contents aren't in the DOM, there's no standard
                  API to do this.
                  
                  Looking back at this issue, though, I'm not sure this is necessary, and if it is necessary
                  not sure it's the right way to fix it.  Browsers could make it more efficient as it
                  stands, namely make
                  
                  input.value = input.value.substr(0, input.selectionStart) + someText + input.value.substr(input.selectionEnd);
                  
                  more efficient somehow for large input values.  And if that's not the right approach,
                  I don't think it actually makes sense to tie this to the user's selection -- maybe
                  you want to replace some slice for some other reason.
                  
                  So I'm going to resolve INVALID, on reflection.  We probably have better things to
                  do.  If there are performance problems with existing browsers, bugs should be filed
                  on them, and we can consider new features if they think that's the best way to solve
                  the problem.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: see comment 2; it was in the spec for a while and didn't get adoption.
                  
                  Note though that you can still register rel=feed as a keyword, and try to get it used
                  and implemented. If successful, it'll result in the spec being updated again to have
                  it.

                  &gt; &gt;
                  &gt; &gt; Do you have any examples of tables you've written recently? It would be helpful
                  &gt; &gt; to see what is different about the tables you're writing that make this more
                  &gt; &gt; attractive to you.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; http://hsivonen.iki.fi/html5-lecture/2011/slides.html#75
                  
                  tr { text-align: center; }
                  tr &gt; :first-child { text-align: left; }
                  tr &gt; :last-child { text-align: right; }
                  
                  Note that there is nothing semantic about the alignment in this table. It's just presentational.
                  The table could easily be styled differently without any loss of usability, just for
                  stylistic reasons.
                  
                  
                  &gt; http://hsivonen.iki.fi/test/moz/meta-caching.html
                  
                  Given the default TD and TH styles, the entirety of the alignment of these tables
                  can be described with a single line of CSS:
                  
                  tr &gt; :first-child { text-align: right; }
                  
                  Again, the alignment here is purely stylistic. In fact I would prefer a style that
                  makes the first column left-aligned but the data cells centered.
                  
                  You could also style this by using &lt;thead&gt; and &lt;tbody&gt; instead of just &lt;tbody&gt;; then
                  the rule would just be:
                  
                  tbody th { text-align: right; }
                  
                  
                  &gt; http://hsivonen.iki.fi/about-blank/ (simply overrides the default th alignment
                  &gt; due to authoring tool making this way more convenient)
                  
                  Again, no semantic need for any particular styling here, and everything can just be
                  done using:
                  
                  td, th { text-align: left; }
                  
                  
                  In all three cases, consider what it would take to change the style with the current
                  markup (with presentational attributes on every non-default cell) and what it would
                  take if you had instead just used the trivial CSS presented above.
                  
                  IMHO this shows quite convincingly exactly what I suspected: that CSS is the better
                  solution here.
                  
                  This is _especially_ true, IMHO, because there is, it seems, no difference between
                  some of the other styles used (backgrounds, borders, border radii, fonts, colors,
                  padding) and alignment. They can all be trivially described in terms of CSS. In fact,
                  in one case (the slides example above) you even have a style rule that is triggered
                  based on the align attribute!

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: Using CSS for this has all the advantages that using CSS has in other cases
                  &#x97; easier maintenance, smaller file sizes, easier to restyle, more control &#x97; and has
                  no additional disadvantages. It doesn't even require new skills, since CSS is already
                  used for styling these tables and since the additional rules are trivial in complexity.

                  up subtitles and tag lines.  From the pages collected so far, there seems to be a
                  tendency towards using h1/h2 and h1/p elements for these purposes.  Some examples
                  are surprisingly close in structure to the design of the hgroup element.

                  &gt; &gt; One of each kind would allow one "subtitle" track and one "caption" track,
                  &gt; &gt; which is what I meant in comment 1.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; So the "default" attribute is really only to decide which of the visible tracks
                  &gt; will be active during playback. OK.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; For "chapters", one chapter track is always enabled regardless of the "default"
                  &gt; &gt; attribute, so adding this doesn't seem useful.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; If there are several chapter tracks, which of them is the one that is enabled?
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Also, I don't think it's clearly stated that a chapter track is always enabled
                  &gt; - at least I wasn't aware of this. Can we make this more explicit?
                  
                  After discussing it through with Hixie on irc, it's clear now: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-iframe-element.html#sourcing-out-of-band-text-tracks
                  bascially says that the first chapter track of the appropriate language will be active.
                  So, OK.

                  &gt; Having thought a bit more, I now think it would make sense to throw by default,
                  &gt; because AFAIK WebIDL already has a way to mark methods that accept a variable
                  &gt; number of arguments. Going forward, spec authors should be required to mark up
                  &gt; those methods accordingly and the rest should throw.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; If Cameron agrees with that we can close this bug again :-)
                  
                  Sorry, I missed this comment until now.  Web IDL recently changed to throw if too
                  few arguments are passed, but to ignore any extra arguments.  Specs shouldn't override
                  this unless they have good reason to (e.g. web compatibility concerns).  I haven't
                  added any syntactic facility to do this overriding in the IDL.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The HTML specification subsumes all previous HTML specifications, and as
                  such it is indeed the appropriate reference for text/html. (Note that this is consistent
                  with past text/html registrations.)

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The spec is correct, though I agree it looks contradictory at first glance.
                  The paragraph in question is really just setting defaults, so that, e.g., you can't
                  change the checkedness of a text field. I tried adding an informative note in the
                  spec to clarify it but I couldn't come up with a good way of doing it that didn't
                  end up taking far more prose than this is worth.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The problem is that if you do that then it becomes essentially impossible
                  to automatically style &lt;h1&gt;, and any other manipulation of sections that relies on
                  the DOM and skips out on implementing the (rather complex) outline algorithm can't
                  even get the basics right.
                  
                  I agree that it is problematic when you mix the two models at a sibling level. Not
                  sure what can be done about that.

                  &gt; &gt; 2. You're still storing your database credentials using this mechanism.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; No, you're not.
                  
                  Ah, I completely misunderstood what you were suggesting.  And it's a pretty great
                  idea.  It had never occurred to me that you can use cookies in pretty much the same
                  way as auth credentials as long as you use them *directly*.  I am so used to session
                  stores that I completely forgot that cookies can store more than just a session ID
                  - and you can completely control them with a wide variety of approaches.
                  
                  Thanks for the idea!  And my thanks to Zewt as well.  I still think from a theoretical
                  standpoint that improving HTTP Auth would be a better choice.  But from a practical
                  standpoint, you're right - it seems like cookies could be used in much the same way
                  - you just have to be more careful with them (i.e. encryption).

                  &gt; &gt; Well don't forget that all those cases where value="" is present but you're
                  &gt; &gt; saying should be treated as indeterminate are cases where the element is
                  &gt; &gt; invalid anyway, so authors really shouldn't be doing any of them anyway.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; But they are going to do that :)
                  
                  Sure, but probably not intentionally. I don't see why we'd try to second-guess what
                  they mean here; they are as likely to want a value=0 determinate bar as an indeterminate
                  one, IMHO.
                  
                  
                  &gt; &gt; Re :indeterminate, it seems easier to define :indeterminate just as a matter of
                  &gt; &gt; whether an attribute is present or not than require that the UA parse the
                  &gt; &gt; attribute to determine it.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; We are already requesting that kind of stuff for :in-range and :out-of-range
                  &gt; which only apply if min and max have a valid value. In addition, for the ease
                  &gt; of implementation, .value is a double so it's very likely that the UA knows if
                  &gt; the value is a valid double or not.
                  
                  Granted.
                  
                  
                  &gt; &gt; Plus, Opera and WebKit already do this...
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; The progress element isn't used that much and Opera and Webkit implementations
                  &gt; already have a few differences with the current specifications. I do not think
                  &gt; we should worry about that.
                  
                  I do worry about it. Nobody is bug free, but adding more bugs isn't a way to get to
                  a bug-free state.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  &gt; Actually, now that :indeterminate is in the specifications, I wonder why we
                  &gt; still need the current behavior. You said it was useful to check if the
                  &gt; progress is indeterminate but now, why is it? I do not believe changing the
                  &gt; specs would cost anything at this point so being conservative seems worthless.
                  
                  I don't see any value in the change you are asking for. It doesn't simplify life for
                  authors, it doesn't simplify life for implementors, it doesn't simplify life for spec
                  writers, and it isn't more "pure". There are no use cases for it, the cases where
                  it would happen are all cases that are non-conforming anyway, it doesn't add any new
                  features, it doesn't seem to solve any problems... I just don't see the point. It's
                  not a matter of being conservative, it's just that I don't see what's wrong with what
                  we have now.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: We actually had this in old Web Forms 2 drafts (it actually normatively
                  referenced XForms for a while!). However, we ended up dropping it:
                  http://html5.org/tools/web-apps-tracker?from=2219&amp;to=2220
                  
                  If browsers pick it up, then it would be worth reconsidering, but in the meantime
                  it seems that the new input values we have introduced mostly address the main use
                  cases for this anyway, so it's somewhat less urgent than it was in the past.

                  Whether we make this MUST or SHOULD won't make any difference to what browser vendors
                  or Web developers do, in practice.
                  
                  In theory, it's a SHOULD because there are times where you can't do it. For example,
                  suppose that you are writing a Web browser for someone whose only possible way of
                  interacting with the page is using a pointing device controlled by blinking their
                  left eyelid. There's no point requiring that the writer of this Web browser also provide
                  a keyboard, since it won't be useful to the user.

                  &gt; Craig, your terminology is incorrect. UTF-8 or Windows-1252 are no "character
                  &gt; sets". See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding for more
                  &gt; information.
                  
                  Hmm, I stand corrected. It just goes to show how what should be a simple concept can
                  be such a confusing concept--it's a shame, too, given how important it is in computing
                  for internationalization and information interchange.
                  
                  Thanks again for the wiki page. Even though I'm wrong in regards to this, I learned
                  something, which is what's most important.
                  
                  Kindest Regards,
                  
                  Craig S.

                  The primary use case for async="" is a third-party analytics script or ad script,
                  which can be completely independent of all other scripts on the page.

                  Status: Did Not Understand Request
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: This seems like a major change. I'm not fundamentally opposed to it (though
                  I am not especially enthusiastic about having to do such extensive surgery on the
                  spec), but I think the compatibility risks are non-trivial. I think before we do this
                  we should try to implement it in a browser and see whether it's practical or not.

                  Rationale: I see no value in allowing an XML character encoding declaration in text/html:
                  it has no effect, so we'd have to limit it to UTF-8, and if we do that, it would have
                  no effect in XML, which defaults to UTF-8. What problem are we trying to solve here?

                  They use the last one with the earliest time if there's several conflicting times.
                  They use different ones if the elements are inserted at different times. Try changing
                  the timing on this one (900, 1100, 2000):
                  
                  http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/js/live-dom-viewer/saved/976
                  
                  IE always goes with the first one, exactly per spec. This is a far simpler solution,
                  and since it's IE doing it, likely not a compat problem. So I think on the whole it
                  would be better to converge on what the spec says now.
                  
                  If you disagree, please actually describe in detail what the conformance criteria
                  should be, because I can't work out how to phrase the more complicated behaviour such
                  that it handles all the various edge cases.

                  &gt; Is this declaration part of an html document?
                  
                  Yes.
                  
                  &gt; Or is this part of a Document

                  No.
                  
                  &gt; Where are DTDs for html documents defined?
                  
                  There are no official DTDs for HTML.
                  
                  
                  &gt; "A Document is always set to one of three modes: no-quirks mode, the default;
                  &gt; quirks mode, used typically for legacy documents; and limited-quirks mode,
                  &gt; also known as "almost standards" mode. The mode is only ever changed from the
                  &gt; default by the HTML parser, based on the presence, absence, or value of the
                  &gt; DOCTYPE string."
                  &gt;
                  &gt; Where do I define, which of the above modes a document is in?
                  
                  You don't, ideally. If you follow the spec rules, you'll always be in no-quirks mode.
                  
                  
                  &gt; "This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and IDL attributes,"
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Does this specification refers to all three or only to two (both?) of the
                  &gt; above attribute series? 
                  
                  It refers to HTML and XML attributes, and to IDL attributes. HTML and XML attributes
                  are the same thing for the purposes of this text.
                  
                  
                  &gt; In the entire document it remains unclear, whether the standard pertains only
                  &gt; to static html/xhtml (as e.g. sent from a web server) or also to dynamic
                  &gt; html/xhtml (as e.g. produced by javascript invoked by user interaction). User
                  &gt; Agents, in some cases, behave differently when receiving a text/html document
                  &gt; from the web server, as opposed to when they execute javascript commands to
                  &gt; generate dynamically the same content. 
                  &gt; Are such User Agents not-conforming to this standard?
                  
                  The spec is intended to cover all of this. Can you clarify why this is not clear?
                  I'm happy to make it clearer, but am not sure where to start.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Could you please make a statement, that the character encoding of an XML
                  &gt; attribute is defined by the Document Type Definition (e.g. &lt;?xml version="1.0"
                  &gt; encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
                  
                  Not sure what this means.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Regarding the examples:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; I would expect, that in a standard document the examples are reproducible in
                  &gt; all aspects, so that when I try an example in a User Agent, I get exactly what
                  &gt; the document says, the example should produce. This is, however, not the case
                  &gt; in many examples for 
                  &gt; &lt;title&gt;
                  &gt; Tabular Data
                  &gt; &lt;/title&gt;
                  &gt; At least as far as border reproduction is concerned, practically all examples
                  &gt; fail, i.e. the examples do not show the border as it should according to the
                  &gt; document. And an example, which makes me first search the error does not help
                  &gt; very much. 
                  
                  HTML doesn't guarantee a particular presentation. You will need to use CSS to change
                  the presentation.

                  &gt; Status: Partially Accepted
                  &gt; Change Description: see diff given below
                  &gt; Rationale:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; (In reply to comment #12)
                  &gt; &gt; We refer to this statement:
                  &gt; &gt; "there must not be two track element children of the same media element whose
                  &gt; &gt; kind attributes are in the same state, whose srclang attributes are both
                  &gt; &gt; missing or have values that represent the same language, and whose label
                  &gt; &gt; attributes are again both missing or both have the same value."
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; This statement says _nothing_ about consumers, user interface, or anything
                  &gt; relating to how the browser is supposed to act.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; I've added some text to the specification that reemphasises this point
                  &gt; generally, as it seems to be a point of common confusion. I haven't added any
                  &gt; text specifically about text tracks because there is nothing special about text
                  &gt; tracks here as opposed to any other feature.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; The spec doesn't define user interface. A browser could be completely
                  &gt; conforming if it never exposed any of the tracks to the user and just
                  &gt; automatically picked one. Or two. Or displayed all of them simultaneously, or
                  &gt; none ever, or had a menu permanently on the screen that allowed the user to
                  &gt; enable or disable them, or handled duplicates by always enabling or disabling
                  &gt; them together, or called them "duplicate one" and "duplicate two" in the user
                  &gt; interface, or downloaded the files and examined them carefully and then used AI
                  &gt; or the Amazon Mechanical Turk to create clear distinguishing titles or printed
                  &gt; the complete text of both text tracks and then required the user to highlight
                  &gt; which cues the user wanted from each text track and then had the user scan the
                  &gt; tracks back in and then enabled and disabled the tracks according to the user's
                  &gt; indicated preference.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; If there are specific requirements on user interfaces that you think are
                  &gt; important for user agents to implement to be accessible to a broad audience,
                  &gt; then that is the kind of thing to put in a UAAG document or to address directly
                  &gt; to the user agent vendors.
                  
                  OK, just to clarify what it means for this particular case: it means that the parsing
                  rules require parsing all available tracks and thus they end up in the JavaScript
                  API, even if the producer does not adhere to the requirements.
                  
                  I am fine with this explanation.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Well, link types can express conflicting information. The more types
                  we get, the more likely it gets.
                  
                  That being said, it can happen with multiple &lt;link&gt; elements, but even in a single
                  &lt;a&gt;.
                  
                  In general, I'd call it an authoring mistake, for which UA behavior will be hard to
                  define without actually knowing the link relation.

                  bothered to increase the limit since this is the only thing hitting it. I'm happy
                  to add more PDFs if someone can provide me with a scriptable Web service that returns
                  the PDF when I invoke it with an updated spec. Contact me either by e-mail (ian@hixi.ch)
                  or on IRC (Hixie on #whatwg on Freenode)

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The name of the event is poor, but it is not useless: it's the time at
                  which you can enable "frame forward" UI.
                  
                  I'm open to adding a separate event that means "you can now play more than N seconds
                  of content", but I'm not sure what N would be useful that is less than the N for canplaythrough.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Actually, you're arguing that there should be three types of events:
                  
                  1. Events which are strictly notifications
                  2. Events which are notifications that something is about to happen, but where
                  the "something" can be cancelled. 
                  3. Events which carry a inherent default action which always happens when the
                  event is submitted, but where the default action can be cancelled.
                  
                  Examples of group 1 is things like "load" and "visibilitychange"
                  
                  Examples of group 2 is things like "error" in indexedDB (cancels transaction unless
                  cancelled), "downloading"/"checking" in AppCache (displays UI in the browser).
                  
                  Examples of group 3 would be "click" and "submit".
                  
                  I argue that we should abandon group 3 and let those events belong to group 2 instead.
                  That way we have fewer types of events. Additionally all events would simply be some
                  form of notification.

                  &gt; This is a presentational issue, and thus out of scope for HTML. It should be
                  &gt; fixed in CSS or the binding language, once we have one. From HTML's point of
                  &gt; view, there's nothing that even guarantees that &lt;select&gt; will _have_ a
                  &gt; drop-down. It could be a dialog (as in Lynx) or a slide-up (as in Mobile
                  &gt; Safari) or an audio prompt (as in speech-based UAs) or it could be some sort of
                  &gt; braille UI or it could be a horizontal sequence of options (as in the Android
                  &gt; keyboard's autocomplete selection widget) or...
                  
                  When this is moved to that CSS section pls warn. I'm for having something like this
                  working so that what is referred here does as we, webmasters, want.

                  with this response, please change the state of this bug to CLOSED. If you have additional
                  information and would like the editor to reconsider, please reopen this bug. If you

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  The premise of the first bit is wrong; the spec uses all kinds of ways to refer to
                  BOMs, depending on whether it's talking about BOMs in general, or the character, or
                  whether it's a normative reference, or a non-normative casual mention, etc. This is
                  demonstrated by the multiple such examples that this very bug mentions.
                  
                  For the second bit: it's just as clear.
                  
                  For the third bit: I don't see what problem this solves. The current text is fine.

                  &gt; Hi,
                  &gt; Can we add Onprogress event similar to ajax model.it is very difficult to
                  &gt; monitor the progress of the connection.
                  
                  Let me elaborate here.When we connect server using websocket spec, can we have a mechanism
                  that will return the number of bytes loaded during the connection process.Something
                  similar to ajax http connection.
               </p>

                  more clear when it says:
                  "Should the pot illegally contain an apple..." That way it covers both the described

                  Status: Did Not Understand Request
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  media.paused definitely doesn't represent if the element is playing or not. There
                  are a lot of ways in which .paused can be false but the element not be playing.
                  
                  Do you have another suggestion? I don't want something less accurate than "is paused
                  or not", but I'm happy to change it if we can find something better.

                  Rationale: 
                  
                  The term "stylistically offset" is gone now.
                  
                  Regarding marking up people, this could make sense, especially as identity becomes
                  more important on the Web. However, it's not clear to me what exactly is needed here.
                  Just being able to mark up someone's name doesn't seem that useful, you really want
                  an identifier. I think this is an area that really requires more experimentation before
                  we can standardise something.

                  spec and lets you enter feedback, you can get rid of it by clicking the arrow at the
                  left.  It's auite annoying in Firefox, because Firefox puts the search result for
                  Ctrl-F at the bottom of the page, which conseauently is obscured by floaty things
                  like this (not that they're all that freauent on the web at large).  Chrome has a
                  higher-auality Ctrl-F implementation -- it scrolls the page so your auery is in the
                  middle, and isn't obscured by things like this.
                  
                  But this auestion doesn't really involve a spec change, so I think I'm aualified to
                  mark it INVALID, to reduce the auantity of bugs Ian has to wade through the next time
                  he tackles the aueue.  I hope my response was adeauate.

                  Current WebKit does, actually; see https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57636
                  
                  &gt; nor does IE.
                  
                  Odd.  IE seems to do it in my testing.
                  
                  &gt; But Gecko and Opera do it
                  
                  Opera is sort of weird: it treats users typing and .value sets differently for textarea
                  (the only browser to do that, as far as I can tell).  See https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57636#c5
                  
                  &gt; ...but four browsers, four results.
                  
                  Fwiw, current dev Chrome and current Firefox agree on that testcase, since that WebKit
                  bug was fixed.  So only 3 results now!  ;)  Though actually it's still 4, because
                  IE9 Standards mode does one thing, while IE9 in IE8, IE7, and compat modes does something
                  else....
                  
                  We'll get to interop sometime, I'm sure.
                  
                  Thanks for making the change!

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  The spec is pretty clear, IMHO, that loop="" loops to the start of the track, and
                  that the "end" part of a media fragment has no effect on media elements.
                  
                  We can change that if there are compelling use cases, but I haven't seen any so far.

                  &gt; Problem: what is a browser to display when the browser navigates to a image or
                  &gt; video resource with a spatial media fragment URI
                  
                  That's more or less out of scope of the HTML spec, no?
                  
                  
                  &gt; or when the @src attribute of
                  &gt; a &lt;img&gt; [...] element contains a spatial media fragment URI
                  
                  Are there any image MIME types that support the media fragment syntax? If not, then
                  the answer is "nothing different".
                  
                  
                  &gt; or &lt;video&gt;
                  
                  For video, the spec just defers to the video format; if the video format supports
                  the media fragment syntax then that'll be defined by the video format spec.
                  
                  In conclusion, this seems out of scope for HTML.

                  Does it need to be made more explicit? I guess I can explicitly give the configuration
                  of the new properties, would that be better? If so, what should it say, exactly? I
                  am not familiar with this new configuration stuff.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: I agree that it's unsatisfactory, but it's not clear what we can do. I've
                  left the spec as is, which is to say, claiming that the parameter can be used to affect
                  the back/forward UI. I'm very open to alternatives, especially if they get implemented.
                  If anyone is interested in changing this please just experiment and report back with
                  what works, and I'll update the spec accordingly!

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The list is a list of people who have said something that has caused the
                  spec to change. I maintain it as I edit the spec. Often people who make suggestions
                  are actually not the first person to make a suggestion, in those cases I list the
                  first person. If there's someone you know has said something that has caused the spec
                  to change but they're not listed in the spec, point me to the bug or e-mail where
                  I made the change in response, and I'll fix it (it does happen!).
                  
                  The acknowledgements aren't a list of members because there's 1700+ WHATWG members
                  and 400+ W3C HTML WG members and a high turnover, and the list would quickly become
                  unmanageable and pointless. (And since anyone can join either group, the list would
                  quickly become just a list of anyone who wants their name listed, which is quite useless).

                  #0 and subsequent comments is substantially identical to any preexisting type of XSS,
                  as far as I can determine based on the discussion.  The only explanation as to why
                  it's different is things like "behave in a seemingly legitimate manner", "completely
                  conforms to the same-origin policy", and other statements that don't appear relevant
                  to the proposed feature.

                  This doesn't conflict with the goal of matching reality; it's just that the reality
                  we are trying to match is the one we expect the spec and all implementations to converge
                  on. (It can't be the present reality, since implementations often disagree with each
                  other.)

                  &gt; born in 37 AD, not BC, contrary to point (2) in comment #0,
                  
                  Ah, bummer.
                  
                  &gt; but I didn't catch
                  &gt; that when I wrote comment #2 -- I was pointing out a separate error.
                  
                  1-0 to you, in this case. :-)

                  is what we need. Whether the document itself claims to be normative or not is besides
                  the point — we can still make it a normative reference, that then makes it one.

                  &gt; Hmm, I shouldn't file bugs on Fridays... It's already defined, just in another
                  &gt; section:
                  &gt; http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/obsolete.html#marquee-loop-count
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; I'll leave the bug open for the editor to decide whether or not to link between
                  &gt; or otherwise consolidate these sections, and possibly listing &lt;marquee loop&gt; in
                  &gt; the attribute summary section.
                  
                  There is already a link. The rendering section uses the "increment the marquee current
                  loop index" algorithm which uses the attribute.
                  
                  (In reply to comment #3)
                  &gt; Also, perhaps all of the loop state algorithm could be replaced by a reference
                  &gt; to http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-box/#marquee-loop
                  
                  That spec doesn't seem to define a processing model.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: "must contain a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces" is
                  an authoring requirement, not an implementation requirement.  It only affects whether
                  the page is valid, and has no bearing on how browsers should process the page:
                  
                  """
                  Note: There is no implied relationship between document conformance requirements and
                  implementation conformance requirements. User agents are not free to handle non-conformant
                  documents as they please; the processing model described in this specification applies
                  to implementations regardless of the conformity of the input documents.
                  """
                  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/infrastructure.html#conformance-classes
                  
                  If you follow the "obtain the resource" algorithm exactly as specified, without making
                  any assumptions based on authoring conformance criteria or other considerations, it's
                  clear that you should only abort if the href is an empty string.  Nothing says you
                  should abort if the href consists of one or more space characters.
                  
                  Please reopen if you either think the spec should change to also include whitespace-only
                  href's, or if you think it should be further clarified somehow to say that it really
                  only means the empty string.  In general, it's hard to clarify this sort of thing,
                  where someone is reading between the lines of algorithms instead of taking them completely
                  literally.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  "HTML documents" means documents that were, for instance, created
                  from pages served as text/html, as opposed to "XHTML documents".  The requirement
                  means that xml:base can only be used in XHTML documents, not (non-XML) HTML documents.
                  It needs to be in the HTML spec because otherwise it would be invalid as XHTML, since
                  anything not mentioned in the spec is invalid.
                  
                  The confusing thing here is that "HTML" can mean both "the abstract HTML language,
                  which has both XML and non-XML serializations" and "the pre-XML serialization of HTML,
                  as specified in the chapter 'The HTML syntax'".  "HTML documents" here means the latter,
                  not the former.  But the HTML specification covers HTML in the former sense, including
                  XHTML.

                  Rationale: The implementation requirements right afterward say "Various algorithms
                  during page loading affect this value", and indeed the HTML parser sets readyState
                  to "interactive" when it's done:

                  So it looks like there's no spec bug here.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  There is an unambiguous definition of the allowed id syntax:
                  
                  "The value must be unique amongst all the IDs in the element's home subtree and must
                  contain at least one character. The value must not contain any space characters."
                  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/elements.html#the-id-attribute
                  
                  The requirements seem perfectly clear, so I'm going to assume you thought this was
                  an actual omission in the spec (maybe due to other specs' tendency to use formal grammars
                  for everything).  Since there is no such omission, I'm resolving the bug as INVALID.
                  If you actually think the id attribute's allowed values need to be defined in some
                  other way, please reopen the bug and the editor will look at it in due course (although
                  he'll probably close WONTFIX unless you give very good arguments).

                  what the problem you're trying to solve is. That's more important than the

                  &gt; My readings had told that H.264 was a free codec... If I try to look for it
                  &gt; more deeper I can see that that is not true.
                  &gt; Where can I find a list of free codecs that are available in a flv, mp4 and mkv
                  &gt; containers (not necessary the 3 at the same time, I just need pairs of codecs)?
                  
                  VP8 in MKV is now called WebM. VP8, Theora, and Dirac are royalty-free video codecs;
                  Vorbis, Speex, FLAC, SILK, and CELT are open audio codecs (amongst some older ones).
                  Of these, your highest chances of getting common support will be WebM and Ogg Vorbis
                  (the first in a MKV container, the second in a Ogg container).
                  
                  While these codecs can certainly be used in other containers, there is no such common
                  use, so you're better off sticking with the typical containers that they come in.
                  
                  But you should listen to Aryeh - you may find it hard to convince Apple and Microsoft
                  to adopt these codecs.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: As far as I understand the issue, there's significant demand and use-cases
                  for out-of-band text tracks, and implementers are interested in supporting them. 
                  Thus a specification is needed to ensure that implementers all support the same format.
                  If you don't think implementers should spend their time on out-of-band tracks, I suggest
                  you take it up with them, so that no specification is needed; this kind of decision
                  is not made by specification editors.  Authors who prefer to use in-band tracks can
                  do that instead -- nothing's stopping them.

                  Check-in comment: Define some types that are never going to be scripting types and
                  are therefore always going to be 'safe' to use as data format types in &lt;script&gt; (even
                  though in practice authors really should be using more specific types).

                  Rationale: The proposed semantics make my head hurt. I can't even imagine trying to
                  explain to this authors. What we have now works fine; if you want an item to have
                  subitems then you put them in the item, just like if you want an item to have two
                  separate paragraphs you put them in the item, or if you want an item to have two paragraphs,
                  two tables, two sublists, and a figure, you put them all in the item. It's the same
                  model we use throughout the spec.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Problem: The language of the spec around allowed rel values does
                  not match the categorizations for allowed rel values in microformats wiki, so it's
                  not at all clear what rel values listed on that page are meant to be allowed and which
                  aren't.
                  
                  But to solve that problem, I don't think we should bother trying to match the language
                  on that wiki closely. I suggest instead that the spec just state, "Any rel value listed
                  on the Microformats wiki existing-rel-values page must be accepted unless that page
                  explicitly states it must not be used."
                  
                  Then, it's up to the maintainers of the page to make it clear there which values listed
                  there must not be used or should not be used.
                  
                  Here are a few more specific details about the differences:
                  
                  Regarding names of link types in rel values, the spec currently states 'values defined
                  in this specification or marked as "proposed" or "ratified" must be accepted...",
                  where 'marked as "proposed" or "ratified"' means marked as such on the microformats
                  "existing rel values" page.
                  
                  http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
                  http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/links.html#other-link-types
                  
                  The spec also says, 'Types defined as extensions in the Microformats wiki existing-rel-values
                  page with the status "proposed" or "ratified" may be used with the rel attribute...".
                  
                  However:
                  
                  1. the microformats "existing rel values" page does not use the word "ratified" at
                  all. It instead has a "formats" category, and says the values in that category are
                  "recommended for general use"
                  
                  2. the microformats "existing rel values" page does not use the word "proposed". Instead,
                  it has a "proposals" category -- which is close -- but in addition to that, it also
                  has other categories for not-yet-"formats"-level (not yet recommended) values; those
                  include "brainstorming", "more brainstorming" (which links to further pages with more
                  rel names), "POSH usage", "WCLR", "non HTML rel values", and "unspecified". For the
                  "proposals" category, it states "You may use these values" and for the "brainstorming"
                  category, it states, "consider trying out these values", but for none of the others
                  does it say anything like "you must not use these values yet", so it would seem that
                  as far as document conformance goes, all of them are essentially "proposed" and so
                  should be valid (as far as the spirit of the law in the spec goes).
                  
                  Finally, the spec states, 'values marked as "discontinued" or not listed in either
                  this specification or on the aforementioned page must be rejected as invalid'. But
                  the wiki page does not have anything marked as 'discontinued'. It instead has "dropped"
                  ("In general, you should not use any dropped values") and "rejected" ("Authors must
                  not use rejected rel values.")
                  
                  Anyway, given all that, we can simplify things in the spec by just replacing the current
                  language with a one-sentence, "Any rel value listed on the Microformats wiki existing-rel-values
                  page must be accepted unless that page explicitly states it must not be used or should
                  not be used."
                  
                  As far as the "should not be used" stuff ("dropped" category), the spec could also
                  include a normative statement requiring conformance checkers to emit warnings for
                  those. Or, handling of reporting for those could instead just be left up to the discretion
                  of conformance-checker implementors.

                  Fragment, path, any part of the URL. Doesn't matter. In all cases of an embedded resource,
                  changing the URL &#x97; whether a fragment or otherwise &#x97; reloads the page. This is true
                  for everything: &lt;iframe&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;embed&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, etc. The only exception I can think
                  of is &lt;script&gt; and that's only because it doesn't do anything at all when you change
                  the URL.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  This still has to be up to the UA, because different platforms have different conventions
                  here.  As far as I can tell, the Mac OS X default behaviour with multiline text fields
                  is to put the caret at the start, and the Mac OS X default behaviour for one-line
                  text fields is to select the text field value. On Windows, the platform behaviour
                  for multiline text fields when they are read-only is to put the caret at the start,
                  but for editable text fields, when the control is focused the entire contents are
                  selected and the cursor is put at the end (though it is not scrolled, so if its contents
                  are bigger than the text field, the cursor won't be visible). For single line text
                  fields, the contents are selected when the control is focused.

                  &gt; 1)  For just about every network connection, download completion needs to
                  &gt; trigger an event handler, which is a really weird thing to do in an unloaded
                  &gt; page.  This is certainly the case for XHR.
                  
                  The way the spec is written today, the task for that event would get queued, and the
                  event loop skips tasks from documents that aren't active, so the event would fire
                  once the document was made active again.
                  
                  
                  &gt; 2)  At least in Gecko, the data structure tracking in-progress network access
                  &gt; is attached to the WindowProxy (because you have to be able to treat a load as
                  &gt; starting in one page but finishing in another).  So on page transition 
                  &gt; requests have to be canceled so as not to affect onload in the new page.
                  
                  Ok.
                  
                  
                  &gt; 3)  Having unloaded pages consume network resources is very much contrary to
                  &gt; user expectations.
                  
                  Yeah, I completely agree that if the download is using up resources then it deserves
                  to be dropped if it's not active.
                  
                  
                  &gt; &gt; (especially if it's only been going for a few milliseconds)?
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; I don't see why this is an "especially" or why it matters.
                  
                  I figure some browsers will want the following model to work:
                  
                  - user is on a page.
                  - every now and then, the page causes a very brief network request.
                  - the user clicks a link on the page.
                  - user then hits the back button.
                  
                  If the user clicked the link while no network request was active, hitting the back
                  button will be fast, because it'll be bfcached. But if a request _was_ active, then
                  it'll be slow. The user can't tell the difference.
                  
                  
                  Anyway. Per spec, the browser is allowed to discard a document in the bfcache whenever
                  it wants. I think we should only be aborting documents and setting their salvageable
                  flag to false in cases where there is really no way that bfcache can work (e.g. when
                  there's an unload event handler). We shouldn't be disallowing cases where implementation
                  difficulties mean that it doesn't work today, but where one could imagine another
                  browser, or the same browser after lots of work, doing it in a way that allowed bfcache.
                  
                  (Note that one exception to this currently is that the spec requires document loads
                  that are in-progress during a navigation to be aborted, regardless of whether it's
                  truly necessary or not. I added that recently, because every browsers does it. Maybe
                  it was a mistake, though.)

                  with this response, please change the state of this bug to CLOSED. If you have additional
                  information and would like the editor to reconsider, please reopen this bug. If you

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: It doesn't seem any of the cases listed in this bug are cases where we
                  cannot imagine a browser successfully using bfcache, so we shouldn't preclude it in
                  those cases. I'm happy to add cases if there are some that are actual problems in
                  all cases.

                  Conclusions:
                  
                  * Only Opera has meaningful support for nested optgroups.  Chrome displays it the
                  same as if you had an extra empty optgroup, and IE/Firefox ignore the contents of
                  the nested optgroups entirely.
                  * In practice, the algorithm in the spec returns exactly the option elements that
                  currently are displayed to the user in the two largest browsers.
                  * IE matches the spec exactly, while all other browsers have mismatches between what
                  the .options attribute displays and what they show to the user.
                  
                  Thus the current spec seems good.  It codifies IE's behavior, which matches Firefox's
                  visual behavior and makes more sense than Chrome's behavior.  The only way I'd see
                  we'd want to change this is if we actually allowed nested optgroups and required behavior
                  like Opera, but those don't serialize, so it's a nonstarter.  There's no reason to
                  change the spec plus IE to account for things that can't actually happen in text/html.

                  Check-in comment: Disallow &lt;link&gt; from having both rel='' and itemprop=''. This might
                  change back if there are compelling use cases, but in the meantime it seems like this
                  is likely to catch errors. This also effectively disallows rel='' on &lt;link&gt;s in &lt;body&gt;.

                  (In reply to comment #20)
                  &gt; I agree with Stefan. The current implementation is illogical.
                  
                  HTML is illogical all over the place.
                  
                  
                  &gt; It breaks the
                  &gt; expected behavior without a good reason to do so (or at least none that i can
                  &gt; see).
                  
                  The element represents a coordinate. The expected behaviour, IMHO, is to send a coordinate.
                  Sending a coordinate and a value is unexpected.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Every input element sends the name-value pair, beside this one. Is there a
                  &gt; logical reason to do so?
                  
                  No, not every input element does this. In fact, the behaviour of input elements is
                  highly inconsistent. type=file includes a file and a filename, checkbox and radio
                  buttons are included or not rather than having their value change, and their value
                  is defaulted to "on" rather than the empty string, &lt;select&gt; elements can have multiple
                  values for one name, the whole thing is completely inconsistent.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Input elements with type=image are not only used as imagemaps, they can also be
                  &gt; used as simple graphical buttons where the X and Y coords are just irrelevant
                  &gt; and what matters is only the name-value pair to say "yes, this button has been
                  &gt; clicked"... more so because the user might not use a pointing device to click
                  &gt; on it making the coords absolutely useless.
                  
                  Sure, and that works fine, regardless of what we do here.
                  
                  
                  &gt; but IMO, by doing so, you are leaving a logical inconsistency in your
                  &gt; specs with an unmotivated exception
                  
                  It's not unmotivated. I've explained the motivations.
                  
                  
                  &gt; to the general rule "every input element
                  &gt; sends the name-value pair" which you should at least make it clear in the HTML
                  &gt; specification since, as i said, this is not what developers would expect.
                  
                  I don't see how it's unclear. The value attribute is not conforming... how could a
                  value be included?

                  &gt; Looks like Gecko, IE, Opera, and the spec all agree. WebKit seems to be the
                  &gt; lone dissenter;
                  &gt; [/quote]
                  &gt; Incorrect. Gecko migrated to the 'work in progress' spec, before, Firefox was
                  &gt; also working in the described way.
                  
                  It might have been incorrect in the past, but it's not incorrect now, which is what
                  I care about.
                  
                  
                  &gt; I posted this bug because of the gazillion
                  &gt; bug reports on the Mozilla bugtracker system, I don't see this as an incident
                  &gt; of one intraset website.
                  
                  Please list the pages affected by this problem. If it affects big sites, or many small
                  sites, then that is data that will affect the decision.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Especially not considering this is a W3Schools example.
                  
                  http://w3fools.com/
                  
                  
                  &gt; Then just answer the trivial question: why is any input type button posting a
                  &gt; name and a value, except for type=image.
                  
                  The premise of the question is false; other types do things other than just post name=value
                  too.
                  
                  But even if that were not true, the answer is "because a coordinate is two numbers,
                  so we return two numbers". Also, "because that's what most browsers do".
                  
                  
                  &gt; It is far from a logical decision,
                  
                  Logic really doesn't factor into HTML's design. There's a reason the WHATWG tag line
                  is "Please leave your sense of logic at the door".
                  
                  
                  &gt; which in this entire thread I am asking for. Why remove the feature and not
                  &gt; complement it like happens for every other input-tag?
                  
                  We didn't remove it. It has never existed except in two rendering engines (now one)
                  which were implementing a non-standard behaviour. Any page depending on this, for
                  example, would never have worked in IE.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  &gt; The proposal in comment 3 doesn't say how the script would get
                  to the data.
                  
                  the &lt;script&gt; block is a node in the DOM and it's content can be accessed using the
                  DOM API - as was shown in comment #3. The spec, however only allows the use of inline
                  script blocks. All I'm suggesting is that this seemingly arbitrary restriction be
                  lifted, or at the very least justified.
                  
                  &gt; I
                  &gt; don't see why it would end up being any less code than using XHR.
                  
                  Again, please see comment #3. Maybe you missed it because it's so simple. That's the
                  point, somewhat.
                  
                  This is the entirety of HTML code required to load an external shader definition and
                  call the 'compileShader' function when the load has completed. The 'defer' or 'async'
                  attributes could be used here to control timing.
                  
                  I'm not going to attempt to post the XHR code. I'd probably get it wrong without any
                  means to verify its correctness.
                  
                  &gt; I also don't see any advantage to this being declarative rather than
                  &gt; imperative, since we're talking about ways to get data to a script.
                  
                  This isn't about getting data to a script. It's about executing script on data.
                  
                  Why is declarative better than imperative? I dunno, ask Tim. This is htMl after all...

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: What's the attack scenario here? I would have set it implicitly on all
                  &lt;img&gt; elements if it wasn't for compatibility concerns, so I don't understand why
                  it would be bad for people to set it. In fact if anything, &lt;img crossdomain src="..."&gt;
                  is safer than &lt;img src="..."&gt; since it removes cookies from the request.

                  cooperating closely.  If that's the case, why don't you just have an onbeforeunload
                  handler on all the pages in the iframe that alters the URL bar using pushState()?
                  Alternatively, why don't you just not use frames at all here, and include everything
                  in the same page?  You have to explain your use-case better.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: If files are saved to the local machine, we cannot tell what sites they
                  came from.  If we let your site's files access other HTML files from the same site,
                  we'd have to let it access HTML files from other sites too, and that could be a privacy
                  violation.  For instance, maybe your files are in a downloads folder together with
                  sensitive HTML files (e.g., internal corporate memos) that your files should not have
                  access to.
                  
                  I encourage you to either make sure your downloaded site consists of only one HTML
                  file (very practical if you use JavaScript), or consider some other delivery mechanism
                  like application caches.

                  &gt; Change Description: no spec change
                  &gt; Rationale: HTML is not a layout language. If CSS doesn't let you style your
                  &gt; pages in the way you want without non-semantic elements, that's something we
                  &gt; should fix in CSS, not HTML.
                  
                  If something may be fixed in CSS, then, in practice, it means this will not be fixed
                  never.
                  
                  Anyway, CSS and HTML are separate things. Probable CSS possibilities cannot be a reason
                  for HTML spec to contain unneeded and harmful restrictions that are purely theoretical
                  and just corrupt page validation process while not making any useful things.
                  
                  Theory should not exist for theory itself. Theory and practice should peacefully coexist,
                  theory should not make practice harder that it should be.
                  
                  The bug is an isolated situation. Please see more common bug report (bug 13062) that
                  I have created.
                  
                  Thanks.

                  Rationale: The attributes on that list are only &lt;input&gt;-specific attributes.
                  
                  Global attributes currently generally have no conformance criteria regarding when
                  they can be used and when they cannot. This may be something we should change, but
                  if so, it's something we should change more generally than just in this context.

                  &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I believe I did provide technical reasons. I provided more reasons
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; than were provided in support of adding the attribute. 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; But I've now added the TrackerRequest back.
                  &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; Please provide a title and text for the issue (including a description of the
                  &gt; &gt; technical issue at hand) when adding TrackerRequest.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; See comment 18 (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12888#c18)
                  
                  That comment seems to contain quite a bit of extraneous commentary.  I've also lightly

                  &gt; In the rel=tag Microformat, the last component of the path segment of the URL
                  &gt; becomes the tag. So, for instance, suppose you have a blog post containing this
                  &gt; link:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; &lt;a rel=tag href=http://example.com/tags/lolcats&gt;other posts tagged
                  &gt; 'lolcats'&lt;/a&gt;
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; In this case, the rel=tag Microformat says that "lolcats" is the tag.
                  
                  Please file a new bug.

                  a request for a new keyword at the Wiki http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions
                  
                  So if anyone thinks it is necessary to register an old keyword (like language) for
                  backward compatability with older browsers or specific browser designed for blind
                  then it should be possible
                  
                  I still don't completely understand **why** this "content" should be part of the standard.
                  Isn't it usual that everything between two quotes is content and not part of the standard,
                  like: title="This text is not part of the standard!"
                  
                  I also think that the message given by the validator should have a reference to the
                  wiki mentioned above.
                  
                  In the end I don't have a problem with this approach of handling with keywords allthough
                  I wonder why none of the keywords at the wiki is "Ratified"

                  &gt; &gt; It's more like a paragraph than a heading.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Only in the second case.
                  
                  In all cases.
                  
                  
                  &gt; &gt; It's just a thematic break, it's not a whole new section.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; The first and third examples don&#x92;t make that clear.
                  
                  The definition of the element is "The hr element represents a paragraph-level thematic
                  break". How can one get more clear than that? The examples are not normative.
                  
                  The first example seems pretty clear on the matter though. Each &lt;hr&gt; separates themes
                  within the section on communication: the first theme is related to stones, the second
                  to radios, the third to flares.
                  
                  I don't know which example you mean by "third example". If you mean the second one
                  in the &lt;hr&gt; section, then it is not hypothetical; it comes straight from a real book,
                  where there's a real thematic break in the form of extra whitespace and a star, which
                  is exactly what &lt;hr&gt; is for.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Remove them or move them to
                  &gt; 4.4 (heading elements) and change "&lt;hr&gt;" to "&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;" as an example for when
                  &gt; an empty heading is useful.
                  
                  An empty heading doesn't make the slightest bit of sense, IMHO. A heading is by definition
                  not something that's empty. The star between two paragraphs in a novel is not a heading,
                  nor a new section. It's just a thematic break.

                  &gt; I think we're not reading the same thing on [2], because that's what I read on
                  &gt; "value" and "step" attributes:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Value    Gets or sets the current position of the progress bar.
                  &gt; Step    Gets or sets the amount by which a call to the PerformStep method
                  &gt; increases the current position of the progress bar.
                  
                  In this API, value is the number from min to max. Changing the value thus sets the
                  position, which is the fraction of the bar that is filled.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: No argument was presented for describing why you would want to change the
                  position directly rather than through the value; the feature is a convenience API
                  that allows authors to expose the current state in other manners trivially (e.g. as
                  a percentage just by multiplying by 100 and truncating appropriately), and no argument
                  was presented for why this is a bad thing to provide; and regarding the name, "position"
                  seems like the best term suggested so far.

                  because for backwards compatibility (with non-HTML cases) plain text editors generally
                  want to have the property that the file is all-ASCII if the user has only entered
                  Basic Latin characters and need to have the property that special markers meant for
                  script interpreters (e.g. #! or &lt;?php) remain intact at the start of the file without
                  getting bytes prepended.

                  &gt; &gt; the W3C. And as noted by editor:
                  &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; "Because using this attribute without testing will cause sites to break 
                  &gt; &gt; when it is implemented, I both encourage user agent vendors to implement 
                  &gt; &gt; it quickly, and urge everyone else to not speak of it loudly until 
                  &gt; &gt; browsers have shipped with support for this attribute."
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; I've removed extraneous commentary:

                  I don't believe it was appropriate of you to remove "extraneous" commentary. However,
                  it isn't worth fighting the point.

                  The dropEffect attribute controls the drag-and-drop feedback that the user is
                  given during a drag-and-drop operation. When the DataTransfer object is
                  created, the dropEffect attribute is set to a string value. On getting, it
                  must return its current value. On setting, if the new value is one of "none",
                  "copy", "link", or "move", then the attribute's current value must be set to
                  the new value. Other values must be ignored.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: As Anne says, we actually did this a few years ago. It was more trouble
                  than it's worth and really there aren't as many use cases as you'd think. In practice
                  you generally end up having to have script anyway so it's no big loss.

                  If the need is just for round-tripping during editing, then there's no need for the
                  editor to limit itself to the HTML standard. Just use a custom attribute documented
                  in a spec that applies to the documents used during editing. You'll need something
                  similar to handle all manner of other round-tripping complications, like whitespace
                  around the DOCTYPE or between attributes, the order of attributes, values in input
                  controls when those aren't the default values, the current alternative style sheet
                  set selection, the current scroll position if it doesn't match an ID, etc etc etc.
                  
                  If you actually want to publish a disabled style sheet, just comment it out.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: Different ports on a shared host can be under the control of different
                  users. In fact this basically gives anyone who can get a user account on a machine
                  essentially XSS access to everything hosted on port 80, which seems quite dangerous.
                  
                  In any case, the IE document seems to only apply to XHR, and seems rather limited
                  even in that context (indeed the document seems to contradict itself on the matter).

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Oh, derp, perhaps I should actually look at the code first.  You
                  are of course right, zcorpan.
                  
                  I hesitate to "correct" such horrible code, but the reason this happens is because
                  &lt;img&gt; are inline by default.  Inline elements generate a linebox, which computes its
                  height from the font-size.  Thus, the &lt;td&gt; is forced to be at least as tall as the
                  linebox.  To fix this, make the &lt;img&gt;s be display:block instead.
                  
                  The reason the "HTML 4.01" doctype worked is because the HTML4 Loose doctype triggers
                  quirks-mode, where &lt;img&gt;s are display:block by default.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Authors can already embed documents using &lt;iframe&gt; or &lt;object&gt; or
                  such.  Most browsers don't currently support rendering document formats this way,
                  but there's no reason they couldn't.  The reason we have special elements for img/audio/video
                  is because we have special standardized attributes that only make sense for them,
                  and special standardized JavaScript APIs.
                  
                  So to add an element like &lt;document&gt;, we'd need clear use-cases that explain what
                  special standardized APIs would be needed, and proof that these use-cases are widespread.
                  We could have APIs that expose the number of pages, allow JS navigation between pages,
                  stuff like that, but is this really something that's so important?  Video is a *huge*
                  use-case, which millions of people use every day.  Document browsing is a lot less
                  so, and (unlike video) can already be handled okay by writing your own display code
                  in JavaScript.
                  
                  So this really needs a convincing explanation of why doing it in JavaScript isn't
                  good enough, and/or interest by a major browser implementer, before there's any reasonable
                  possibility that we spec it.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: This bug, as originally filed and then amended, postulated that &lt;wbr&gt; and
                  zwsp are equivalent, and asked for that to be clarified.  However, per the current
                  spec, they are not equivalent.  Making them equivalent is what bug 9097 requests,
                  and I've left that open for Hixie to review the evidence you provided.
                  
                  Could you please explain what this bug is supposed to do in addition to bug 9097?
                  If 9097 is fixed, &lt;wbr&gt; and zwsp will be defined as equivalent as requested.  If 9097
                  is wontfixed, this bug is invalid because &lt;wbr&gt; and zwsp are defined to *not* be equivalent:
                  e.g., as now, &lt;wbr&gt; will be defined to create a break even in &lt;pre&gt;.  So I don't get
                  what this bug is asking for now.

                  wrong with it that would justify supporting a redundant mechanism to do the same thing?

                  For the W3C spec: The WG has decided to remove the Unicode names everywhere, so that
                  would (once I implement that change) be inconsistent.
                  
                  For the WHATWG spec: Dude the table is way too big already. Just look up the code
                  if you need the name. It's much more likely that you'd already have the name and code
                  and would be looking for the char ref name for it.

                  &gt; I agree with Boris, it's unlikely that we'd implement this in Firefox. It's
                  &gt; simply too easy to trick the user into selecting a file that they don't intend
                  &gt; to share. Here's one attack scenario:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; 1. Add a &lt;input type=file value="/etc/passwd"&gt; on a page
                  &gt; 2. Use CSS to make the &lt;input&gt; 1x1 pixels large
                  &gt; 3. Put a &lt;a href="money.html"&gt;Click here for free money&lt;/a&gt; link on the page
                  &gt; 4. Use javascript to detect when the user hovers the above link
                  &gt; 5. Use CSS to position the &lt;input&gt; just under the cursor.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Once the user attempts to click the link it will instead open a filepicker.
                  &gt; Most people's reaction to this would be "get out of my way stupid dialog, I
                  &gt; want to click my free-money link" and simply press "OK" in the file picker.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; This is generally known as the "whatever button". When faced with a dialog
                  &gt; people generally don't bother reading its contents but instead think "whatever"
                  &gt; and press any button that will allow them to continue with their task.
                  
                  I also go with whatever. But instead, I ALWAYS use the cancel button instead of the
                  ok button. Still... I see what you mean...
                  
                  I'll do a worksforme as this is not going to be easy enugh to implement.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: Quirks mode is evil -- it makes the platform significantly more confusing
                  and complicated, both for authors and implementers.  We want to keep the differences
                  between quirks and standards to an absolute minimum.  The only grounds for standardizing
                  quirks are if they have to be quirks for web compat, or (theoretically) if the behavior
                  is extremely horrible but we can't get rid of it completely but we could get away
                  with making it a quirk.
                  
                  In this case, if we don't want support for &lt;wbr&gt;, we can remove support entirely.
                  As you point out, compat is not an insurmountable issue here, since browsers don't
                  consistently support it anyway.  Thus we should get rid of it if we don't want it,
                  and keep it in all modes if we do.  Making it quirks-only is the worst of all worlds.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: This is a presentational issue and should be handled in CSS.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Such old IE versions (6+7) has very little market share--less than 10%. So they
                  &gt; cannot be a reason to abandon improvements in the HTML standard at all.
                  &gt; Backward compatibility is a good thing, but it has its own limits---main limit
                  &gt; is common sense.
                  
                  They have 10 times more market share than Opera, and we consider Opera important.
                  
                  
                  &gt; If a web-developer do care about semantics, then he always use closing tags.
                  
                  That's an incorrect assumption.
                  
                  
                  &gt; To make using divs inside lists clear, we can just clearly describe requirement
                  &gt; in HTML spec like this:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; &lt;&lt;
                  &gt; DIV element as direct child of list is allowed only if all items of the list
                  &gt; has closing tags. Otherwise, markup will be ambiguous and should be considered
                  &gt; invalid.
                  &gt; &gt;&gt;
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; That's all.
                  
                  That would be incredibly confusing to authors. It would also be a layering violation
                  &#x97; the content model of a document should not depend on the syntax used for it. We
                  have been forced into that situation because of limitations of XML already, and it's
                  not pretty.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Consider this example where list is multi-column (each div is separate column):
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; &lt;style&gt;
                  &gt; UL {display: table; }
                  &gt; UL &gt; DIV {display: table-cell; }
                  &gt; &lt;/style&gt;
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; &lt;ul&gt;
                  &gt;     &lt;div&gt;
                  &gt;         &lt;li&gt;first&lt;/li&gt;
                  &gt;         &lt;li&gt;column&lt;/li&gt;
                  &gt;     &lt;/div&gt;
                  &gt;     &lt;div&gt;
                  &gt;         &lt;li&gt;second&lt;/li&gt;
                  &gt;         &lt;li&gt;column&lt;/li&gt;
                  &gt;     &lt;/div&gt;
                  &gt; &lt;/ul&gt;
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; How do you achieve same effect with classes assigned to single list items?
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; (Just in case: please do not mention CSS3 Multi-column Layout---such means are
                  &gt; very limited in practice.)
                  
                  CSS multi-column layout is exactly how you solve the problem of multiple columns of
                  layout.
                  
                  However, to answer your question without CSS multicolumn layout:
                  
                  &lt;style&gt;.a { float: left; clear: left; width: 10em; }&lt;/style&gt;
                  &lt;ul&gt;
                  &lt;li class="a"&gt;first&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li class="a"&gt;colunm&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li class="b"&gt;second&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;li class="b"&gt;column&lt;/li&gt;
                  &lt;/ul&gt;
                  
                  ...so that's two ways of doing it in CSS now.
                  
                  The point of splitting HTML markup and CSS styles is that you can then style the same
                  markup multiple ways. If you're using &lt;div&gt;s to get the style you want then you can't
                  do this. For example, take the markup you have above with the divs: now how do you
                  put the first three &lt;li&gt;s into the first column and the last one into a second column,
                  without changing the markup? The point is that if what you're doing is stylistic,
                  then it shouldn't affect the markup at all.

                  Ian said:
                  &gt; Rationale: The argument here basically boils down to "the user might skip the
                  &gt; text before the table by jumping straight to the table, and thus not understand
                  &gt; what the table is about". Well yes. They might also skip past a paragraph and
                  &gt; read the next one, and thus not know what the paragraph is about. At the end of
                  &gt; the day, readers have to read the page to understand what it says, whether it's
                  &gt; with a screen reader, reading directly from a screen, or any other mode.
                  
                  ?? I don't understand this comment,  it seems like a non-sequitor. Either I wasn't
                  clear or you don't understand the point I'm trying to make. For a start a screen reader
                  isn't just a 'reader'. Blind people don't just sit there passively while every page
                  is read in toto! It is primarily a 'navigation' and then a 'reading' device. Your
                  comment indicates that you may not understand that. Apologies for being so frank.
                  
                  &gt; Authors aren't going to be adding markup to handle readers who aren't reading.
                  &gt; What if the reader were to skip past the summary?
                  
                  I'm sorry but again I don't really understand this comment. The point of a markup
                  language is to create a 'programatic association' between elements and labels, and
                  various data. Visually, you or I as sighted people can very quickly scan a document
                  and make these connections, a non sighted person cannot. Therefore the AT, by being
                  able to understand explicit programatic associations made within the markup can inform
                  the user of various relationships and help them to understand the content of a web
                  document. They cannot make the split second associations that a sighted person can
                  from viewing a page. Yes, a screen reader user can skip over content and *may* miss
                  certain things but thats not the point. If there aren't explicit programatic associations
                  such as &lt;captions&gt; for tables, @summary info, @alt for images or whatever, they *will*
                  miss these relationships and their view or reading (as you say) of the content will
                  be incomplete.
                  
                  I hope that you would agree this isn't desirable, and that the HTML5 markup language
                  should endeavor to support people with disabilities using Assistive Technologies.
                  Some of the examples (as for the reasons outlined above) have a poor level of accessibility,
                  right now. Tomorrow that may improve. The simple point I'm trying to make is that
                  we have existing mechanisms that do 'today' what these examples hope to do tomorrow.
                  I really don't see the problem with supporting existing methods that while may not
                  be perfect - work. In time they can be superseded by better methods. Indeed this was
                  once a mantra of this working group.

                  [...]
                  &gt; Rationale: I don't understand the example, nor why one would need ARIA here.
                  
                  To complete the example you need to add:
                  
                  &lt;table aria-describedby="inline_desc"&gt;
                  &lt;caption&gt;Characteristics with positive and negative sides&lt;/caption&gt;
                  &lt;thead&gt;
                  
                  [...]
                  
                  To the table, which will create a programatic association with the description contained
                  in the &lt;p&gt;. I hope this is clearer. The reason an example of how ARIA can be used
                  to describe a table should be included in the HTML5 spec, is because it is a new method
                  of making tables more accessible and ARIA is now a full citizen of HTML5.
                  
                  I hope this is clearer.
                  
                  &lt;code&gt;

                  &gt; Rationale: What exactly is incorrect with the spec text you cite?  UTC-04:00 is

                  OK. My first reading of the example was that the time zone (... in use on the east
                  coast of the USA during daylight saving time) would be implied by the given date-time
                  literal, what is certainly not correct.
                  
                  But as far as I can see, the only time zone that is relevant for this spec is UTC,
                  what perfectly corresponds with the lack of calendaring support in ECMAScript. So
                  the example may probably not confuse readers too much.
                  
                  Sorry for the noise.

                  Rationale: 
                  
                  There's a simple way to do it: list the file in the manifest and give it a manifest=""
                  attribute pointing to the manifest.
                  
                  We can't just fetch the file from the network then use the files from the cache, because
                  the files from the cache could be a year old by the time the user goes to the page,
                  and in that case the page is highly likely to completely break if it's fetched in
                  this way. This is a problem with FALLBACK-enabled resources also, but there's no obvious
                  workaround for those cases.

                  Rationale: 
                  
                  &lt;input type="url"&gt; can already accept URLs with protocol omitted, it's up to the UA.
                  
                  A UA can in fact use whatever UI it wants here. It could have a UI consisting of a
                  large full-screen selection of the user's three most-visited sites, and only allow
                  the user to select one of those three sites' URLs, without the user ever seeing the
                  URL, only ever seeing screenshots of those sites. It could require that the site dictate
                  the URL character by character. It could prevent the user from giving http:// URLs
                  altogether, always forcing the domain and path given by the user to be prefixed by
                  https://. It could provide a complicated multi-segment editor where you get to select
                  the scheme by drop-down, then type in the domain, then select the port using a spinner
                  control. It could allow you to select the URL only by asking you to type in keywords
                  which it then uses to perform Bing searches from which it uses the URL of the first
                  result. It could require you to mime the description of the page whose URL you want
                  to give. It could display pretty icons for the scheme and not show it at all.
                  
                  If you want something different &#x97; for example, if you want the browser to just send
                  to the server the exact string that the user typed &#x97; then you should not use type=url,
                  you should use type=text.
                  
                  Note that nothing requires that the UA show to the user that it is automatically prefixing
                  an incomplete URL with "http://". Indeed, nothing requires that the UA show the URL
                  to the user at all. The UA could just always show "http://foo.example.com/" and never
                  show the user's input to the user, instead requiring the user to type blindly.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: We don't have to sandbox all media types. HTML and XML are the only ones
                  that are problematic, and XML doesn't yet have realistic use cases here (and could
                  in the future be easily addressed by a separate sandboxing type for XML — I'll let
                  the XML community worry about that).
                  
                  The reason for having this type is so that someone can host an HTML file sandboxed
                  in an iframe, yet still be safe from hostile people pointing their users at unsandboxed
                  iframes pointing at that document. There's no reason to have the "allow-*" keywords
                  here, they'll be on the iframe.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The change you suggest would require significant architectural changes
                  to HTML, such as introducing an infinite number of new entities/elements or adding
                  additional magic to the parser (so one entity/tag creates many characters/elements
                  in the DOM).  Moreover, as comment 1 points out, using many &amp;nbsp; or &lt;br&gt; in a row
                  almost certainly indicates you're using them to create a precise amount of spacing,
                  and you should really be using CSS instead.  Thus there's very little reason we'd
                  want to support this, and it would be difficult to support it even if we wanted to.

                  I don't know which section you mean by 6.1.6.2. If you mean the "List of event handler
                  content attributes" table, then of course DOMContentLoaded isn't listed... it's an
                  event, not an event handler, and has no corresponding event handler.
                  
                  I also don't understand what the paragraph you suggest adding means. All the event
                  handler content attributes are listed in that section, or at least meant to be.

                  &gt; Does this mean if I'm creating a custom media element control, I can safely
                  &gt; leave the controls attribute off the media element? That if the user has
                  &gt; disabled JavaScript (which would disable my custom control), the user agent is
                  &gt; supposed to automatically expose this user interface?
                  
                  Yes, that seems clear.
                  
                  (In reply to comment #2)
                  &gt; Only Opera actually turns on the UI if scripting is disabled. This would seem
                  &gt; to further support my concern that this behavior just isn't expected. 
                  
                  That suggests bugs should be filed against non-Opera browsers.
                  
                  &gt; I also think the use of "should" is ambiguous. I believe to be effective, it
                  &gt; should be changed to "must", perhaps with a more emphatic sentence structure to
                  &gt; ensure that developers don't have to try the code out in every browser in order
                  &gt; to verify that yes, they did read this sentence correctly.
                  
                  Hixie normally doesn't use anything stronger than "should" for UI requirements.  I
                  agree that "must" would be appropriate here, but I don't think it makes a big difference
                  -- "should" still means "must unless there's some good reason not to".
                  
                  (In reply to comment #7)
                  &gt; But you're removing the options for the web page author or developer. You're
                  &gt; making a value judgment for everyone. 
                  
                  The only option that's being taken away is that authors can't disable built-in controls
                  when scripting is disabled.  Do you think any authors would legitimately want to do
                  that?  That would leave the user with no controls at all.
                  
                  &gt; However, now we don't know if the controls will display or not because of
                  &gt; browser differences. Frankly, we have to code the removeAttribute anyway
                  &gt; because of these differences--the functionality buys us absolutely nothing.
                  
                  That's a problem with the browsers, not the spec.  The spec's behavior makes the most
                  sense.  If browsers don't display controls unconditionally when script is disabled,
                  they're buggy: they leave the user with a non-functioning media player if the author
                  didn't add a controls attribute.

                  Rationale: See above.  I don't see anything that's unclear or incorrect about the
                  text you quoted, so I don't see what change there is to make.  Please reopen if you
                  either have specific suggestions for how the text could be clearer, or think that
                  the non-Opera behavior is better than the Opera behavior and that the spec should
                  change to require that.  Failing that, I'd suggest you file bugs against any browsers
                  that aren't following the spec.

                  &gt; HTML Accessibility Task Force agrees with the Editor's response to this bug in
                  &gt; comment 3, but has decided to track the bug in case it gets reopened. We would
                  &gt; not want to see the proposal implemented as that would impair many assistive
                  &gt; technologies.
                  
                  The converse is that if we don't get authors the control they need, they'll just stick
                  with Flash, and that can be even more inaccessible.
                  
                  However, I have no intention of re-opening this bug. I can't speak for others, though.

                  Rationale: 
                  
                  We definitely don't want to prevent authors from changing how hidden="" is implemented
                  at the CSS level. For example, I have in the past changed it to opacity:0 so that
                  I can do animations on opacity using transitions. One could do similar things with
                  other properties, e.g. height:0 to do a roll-up.
                  
                  I do agree that it is rather annoying that every rule with 'display' in it ends up
                  wacking the default [hidden] rule. Not sure what we can do about it though. It's not
                  really any different than the way you have to be careful about not blowing away the
                  'display' property of &lt;table&gt; or the 'font' property of &lt;h1&gt; or whatnot. I'm skeptical
                  about adding a new layer to the cascade; first the cascade is pretty complex already,
                  and second it would be confusing to suddenly have this one feature that has to be
                  overridden by !important.
                  
                  If anyone has any other ideas, though, we should definitely consider them.

                  &gt; Under Section 8.1.3.1 of HTML 5:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; "Where character references are allowed, a character reference of a U+000A LINE
                  &gt; FEED (LF) character (but not a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character) also
                  &gt; represents a newline."
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; In other words, &amp;#xD; is ignored.
                  
                  No, what you quote is not at all saying that &amp;#xD; is ignored. It's saying that if
                  you want to represent a newline, you can use &amp;#xA;, but not &amp;#xD;.
                  
                  If you read the parser section, you'll see &amp;#xD; turns into a U+000D character, which
                  doesn't represent anything useful in HTML.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  As far as I am aware, nothing links checkboxes together currently — there's no more
                  of a relationship between two type=checkbox inputs with the same name and two type=text
                  inputs with the same name. type=radio are a special case of their own.
                  
                  We could change that for type=checkbox and required="", but I'm skeptical that it's
                  that good an idea. If you really want the user to select one or more from a list,
                  use &lt;select multiple required&gt;.

                  authors face today and that cannot be solved without adding new features.  An idealized
                  and overly elaborate explanation of the procedure for adding significant new features

                  &gt; (In reply to comment #65)
                  &gt; &gt; If all the page generator (human author or otherwise) has is the URL to the
                  &gt; &gt; content then how will it know the type of content?
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; That's what mime types are for.
                  
                  If the page in question sets the src attribute of the video element with the content
                  URL, there is no need for the mime type.
                  
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; If the author doesn't know the media type/can't find out through probing, why
                  &gt; &gt; &gt; would the browser get it right?
                  &gt; &gt; 
                  &gt; &gt; The browser has access to the content-type when it tries to play the content,
                  &gt; &gt; right?
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; The JS developer has that access, too, via the getResponseHeader() function,
                  &gt; see http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/#the-getresponseheader-method .
                  
                  I don't understand the relevance of XHR to this? All the page and UA have is a URL
                  to a content item. 
                  
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Is that sufficient or do you have a use case beyond this?
                  
                  No, the suggestions aren't sufficient for the above-stated reasons.
                  
                  If there is a way JS can determine the type of a content item given only the URL then
                  I think that would suffice. Otherwise, I think it would be better for the UA to tag
                  the dispatch string as suggested based on the mime type it will have when playing
                  the content. This always works and makes no assumptions about what content metadata
                  is available at page creation.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: &lt;caption&gt; has abnormal legacy parsing behavior when it occurs in a table
                  cell that's too risky to change. Since it's assumed that you can use just about anything
                  you can use as a child of &lt;body&gt; as a child of &lt;td&gt;, it doesn't make sense to expand
                  the applicability of &lt;caption&gt; from its current purpose.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  &gt; The HTML4
                  &gt; specs did not limit the use of the attribute to only text/number types
                  
                  The HTML4 spec isn't particularly relevant here.
                  
                  Implementations have historically limited the readonly attribute in this way. They
                  do this because there's no UI concept that corresponds to a "readonly" radio button,
                  checkbox, button, etc. It's a concept that only applies to text fields.
                  
                  
                  &gt; (a) functionally, disable shuts down the control entirely, preventing
                  &gt; all access and submission (the "successfulness" of the control) whereas
                  &gt; readonly allows tabbing to, submission and scrolling if some portion
                  &gt; of the content is hidden.
                  
                  Right. It makes no sense to scroll a radio button, range control, color control, etc.
                  Only text fields can be scrolled.
                  
                  There's no point tabbing to a control that is in no way interactive.
                  
                  It is bad UI to have a "not disabled but non-interactive" control. Thus, we disallow
                  it on all the controls where that would be the result, on the basis that it will discourage
                  authors from making that mistake.
                  
                  The submission thing is a historical artifact. If you need to submit a value but don't
                  want the use to change it, use type=hidden.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Secondly, we can't assume that color values will always be immune to 
                  &gt; the same data visibility issues that affect textual data.
                  
                  If it ever changes, we can change the spec.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Similarly, ranges can have a visual representation, but they can
                  &gt; also have a textual representation (5000-10000) which would have the same
                  &gt; issues of needed to access the field and cursor through it to see
                  &gt; the entire value if the display area for the value is too small.
                  
                  Ranges by definition do not have a textual representation — they do not represent
                  a specific number. That's what type=number is for.
                  
                  
                  &gt; (b) visually disable usually grays out or "fuzzes" a field whereas
                  &gt; readonly simply shades it to indicate that the value can't be edited.
                  &gt; This helps users know the difference between information they need to
                  &gt; pay attention to (even if they can't change it) and information that
                  &gt; they can ignore as irrelevant.  Although the semantic distinction
                  &gt; between "can't edit right now" vs. "not applicable" isn't in
                  &gt; the specification it is common out in the wild and making it possible
                  &gt; to apply have the browser apply it simplifies user interface
                  &gt; implementation.
                  
                  There isn't a concept of "readonly" for controls other than text fields in UI widget
                  toolkits.

                  the checkbox at the same command, so that the buttons, keyboard shortcuts, etc, all
                  end up driven by the same underlying checkbox logic, and the author doesn't have to
                  worry about it. (This isn't yet in the spec, admittedly.) The behaviour you describe
                  for the Window menu is a radio button menu item, not a checkbox.
                  
                  For checkboxes, I could maybe see an argument for letting authors check and uncheck
                  things. For radio buttons, though, that's just a pain. Surely you agree that radio
                  buttons should be automatic?
                  
                  I've fixed the definition of the activation behaviour (so it doesn't fire a second
                  click event, d'oh). It is still unlike the &lt;input&gt; element in that the .checked value
                  isn't changed until after the click event has fired (and not been canceled), though.

                  &gt; Test case:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; http://intertwingly.net/tmp/bug13409.xhtml
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Current status is that the latest release of Opera will resolve the &amp;sect;
                  &gt; entity reference, and that the latest releases of IE, Firefox, Safari, and
                  &gt; Chrome will not.
                  
                  So clearly the failing ones are following the spec as written currently.
                  
                  I can't tell from here whether Opera is just loading the entities from somewhere or
                  (as I suspect) falling back to html parsing if xml parsing fails. Either way isn't
                  conforming with the current draft.
                  
                  That document (despite my comment that you quote below) is however not a particularly
                  good example of the issue at hand as it is not a well formed XML document and would
                  give a fatal parse error if given to a standard xml parser as the entity is not defined.
                  
                  Better is the example of the MathML2 spec give in comment 3 that is a well formed
                  XML document and was parsed as such by all relevant browsers at the time (IE, Firefox,
                  netscape) as being the only ones of that era with any mathml support. IE loaded the
                  DTD specified and gecko at the time loaded its own entity definitions given a &lt;!DOCTYPE
                  of that form. The browsers changed to match an html5 draft thus _breaking_ existing
                  content.
                  
                  
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Given this, do we have any reason to believe that if the spec were to change
                  &gt; in the manner described by this bug report that this behavior will meet the
                  &gt; published exit criteria for the HTML WG:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/public-permissive-exit-criteria.html
                  
                  Given that there is a list of PUBLIC identifiers that trigger entity loading adding
                  one more is essentially a trivial implementation change: I would have no reason to
                  suppose it wouldn't be implemented if specified but if it goes to the wider WG implementers
                  (rather than just editors) would have the chance to say.
                  
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; The reason why I ask is that adding it now just to remove it later is not a
                  &gt; good use of our collective time.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; --------------------------------------
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Chair hat off:
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; re: "it would be preferable if the html5 entity definitions were also loaded
                  &gt; for the standard HTML5 doctype declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; or all doctypes"
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; doctypes like application/xhtml+xml or application/xml should be
                  &gt; processesable via standard XML toolchains.  This would not be the case if
                  &gt; the proposal were adopted.  Example:
                  &gt; 
                  
                  "processable" in that context would mean specifying an xml catalogue that defaulted
                  the dtd. That isn't the default behaviour but most xml parsers may be configured to
                  use a catalog. However despite my earlier preference I don't want to argue for that
                  version now (as I suspect that it is harder to get consensus for it) I just argue
                  that an additional PUBLIC identifier be added to the list
                  at 
                  
                  http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/single-page.html#parsing-xhtml-documents
                  
                  the public identifier should identify a DTD that defines the HTML5 entity set (none
                  of the existing ones in the list do that) the PUBLIC identifier
                  
                  -//W3C//ENTITIES Combined Set//EN//XML
                  
                  used on 
                  
                  http://www.w3.org/2003/entities/2007/w3centities-f.ent
                  
                  would be one choice but any PUBLIC identifier that does not already identify an incompatible
                  set of definitions would do.

                  them eminently searchable and helps implementors be clear about what they're talking
                  about.

                  A rule of thumb that I've found useful in distinguishing which communities are worth
                  mentioning separately is to explicitly mention those that rely on different accessibility
                  technology to work with the Web: e.g. blind users need screenreaders to use the Web,
                  partially sighted users usually get away with screen magnifiers. So it makes sense
                  to separate out these groups.
                  
                  This approach arrives basically at the same list that Leonie gave (but her explanation
                  being much more eloquent):
                  * People who are Deaf or hard of hearing.
                  * People who are blind or partially sighted.
                  * People with cognitive disabilities.
                  * People with physical disabilities.

                  say, the browser in question has no screen!) makes no sense.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: 
                  
                  If someone writes a program that converts HTML files to PDF files, and has a "preview"
                  mode that shows the PDF file, it is an interactive program that accepts user input,
                  but it would still just be a non-interactive presentation user agent, and that would
                  not be inappropriate (on the contrary, it would make no sense for such an application
                  to be any other conformance class). So I don't think the "should" you are suggesting
                  is an appropriate requirement.
                  
                  At the end of the day, a developer writing an application so limited in scope that
                  they only designed it for one input modality isn't going to be swayed by this section.
                  Imelda should just switch to a better vendor (of which there are many).
                  
                  Note also that making the sample limited applications you describe accessible is much
                  easier than making it support the entire suite of HTML APIs and interaction features.
                  What you are suggesting would require that the application that displays a static
                  Web-based slide also support interactive HTML form controls, which sounds like it
                  would be way out of the scope of what such an application should be doing.
                  
                  Just because you're not a full Web browser doesn't mean you shouldn't be accessible.
                  Any commercial application on a general purpose computer should be accessible to all
                  users of that computer, that's got nothing to do with the HTML spec and everything
                  to do with simple ethics and common sense.

                  Duplicating the link is even worse in UAs that convert the &lt;map&gt; to a list of links.
                  It is more likely that graphical UAs exposing stuff to ATs will do the right thing
                  here than non-graphical UAs, since the former have far more engineering resources
                  available.

                  Removing the sentence quoted would have no effect (it's not a normative sentence —
                  it's just describing the results of other rules).
                  
                  However, this is a non-issue. It's trivial to use an image map with &lt;object&gt; and only
                  give it once and make it accessible: just put the image map inside the &lt;object&gt;.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale:
                  
                  The example is correct.  In the current HTML spec, any tag that's heading content
                  starts a new section:
                  
                  """
                  The first element of heading content in an element of sectioning content represents
                  the heading for that section. Subsequent headings of equal or higher rank start new
                  (implied) sections, headings of lower rank start implied subsections that are part
                  of the previous one. In both cases, the element represents the heading of the implied
                  section.
                  """
                  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/sections.html#headings-and-sections
                  
                  Thus &lt;h1&gt;foo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;bar&lt;/h2&gt; marks up a rank-one section whose contents begin with
                  a rank-two subsection.  &lt;hgroup&gt;&lt;h1&gt;foo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;bar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/hgroup&gt; marks up the start
                  of a rank-one section with no subsection (at least, it doesn't start with one).  An
                  example of a case where &lt;h1&gt;foo&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;bar&lt;/h2&gt; would be correct is something like
                  &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Egyptian_temple&amp;oldid=442681377&gt;, which
                  has
                  
                  &lt;h2&gt;Functions&lt;/h2&gt;
                  &lt;h3&gt;Religious&lt;/h3&gt; ...
                  &lt;h3&gt;Economic and administrative&lt;/h3&gt; ...
                  
                  In this case, the lack of an &lt;hgroup&gt; indicates that the entire contents of the "Functions"
                  section consists of two subsections, "Religious" and "Economic and administrative".
                  
                  The example obviously will have to be fixed if &lt;hgroup&gt; is removed, but for now it's
                  correct.

                  Status: Rejected
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: HTML relies on many other specifications and registries, and the practice
                  is well accepted in the standards world.  For instance, HTML requires that lang attribute
                  values be valid according to BCP47, which in turn defers to an IANA registry.  It
                  is not practical to include all registries in HTML proper.
                  
                  If poorly-written regulations require organizations to conform to particular versions
                  of standards, without allowance for revisions to those standards over time, that's
                  something that has to be fixed in the regulations.  We are not responsible for people
                  who use our standards in ways they aren't intended to be used.  Authoring conformance
                  requirements are designed to inform authors of possible errors and encourage them
                  to voluntarily fix their pages -- they aren't meant to be mandatory.

                  2) The UI is supposed to display the e-mail addresses in Unicode. Until Unicode is
                  widely supported on the server, though, there's no benefit to sending that rather
                  than punycode as far as I can tell.

                  &gt; the examples. It's an incentive to get the software fixed.
                  
                  I am happy to say that in the latest round of testing:
                  http://www.html5accessibility.com/tests/form-labels.html
                  All major browsers (except Opera) tested now support both methods robustly and as
                  Opera does not have practical support for assistive technology on any platform, its
                  lack of support can be discounted.
                  
                  so closing the bug.

                  &gt; &lt;th scope="col"&gt; would not be sufficient for tables because it is only usable
                  &gt; on tables that have heading rows or columns, whereas tables are often used
                  &gt; without them. Thus, tables require a separate attribute such as
                  &gt; orientation="columns".
                  
                  Can you point to an example of the sort of table you have in mind?
                  
                  &gt; In addition, it's worth considering that tables are only one example of the
                  &gt; general problem of reading order being different from document order. 
                  
                  [snip]
                  
                  &gt; A common example of the latter is many news web sites where selecting an
                  &gt; article and its title also selects a sidebar because it immediately follows the
                  &gt; title in the source document, even though visually it appears to follow the
                  &gt; article, being displayed in a separate column on the right.
                  
                  The general problem of allowing authors to distinguishing a logical order from a visual
                  layout order will be solved by CSS features currently in draft:
                  
                  http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-grid-layout/
                  
                  http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-regions-20111129/
                  
                  Even when visual layout order is incorrectly pushed into the HTML layer, authors can
                  use the @aria-flowto attribute to indicate a logical reading order:
                  
                  http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-flowto
                  
                  Why do you think we should introduce additional HTML features for this?

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: It would make no sense to allow 'display' as the cues have their own custom
                  display logic. Similarly position/top/left/bottom/right/height/width make no sense
                  as the cues themselves give their dimensions and position. 'overflow' makes no sense
                  since 'auto' and 'scroll' would be meaningless and 'visible' would defeat the whole
                  point of some of the positioning logic. I don't see the use case for 'clip'. 'cursor'
                  seems pointless since they're not interactive. 'z-index' might maybe make sense, but
                  why would you intentionally overlay cues and then layer them out of order?

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  There's definitely ways to build them without this feature. Just
                  have the server check which button was pressed, and act accordingly, or put the forms
                  after each other. That's what people do now (e.g. this very page does that — it has
                  the bug form in the middle and search forms at the top and bottom). It makes maintenance
                  difficult. Sometimes people split the other form into an entirely separate page, e.g.
                  the way that the "Add an attachment" feature above opens a separate page instead of
                  being done inline.
                  
                  I don't see why the form="" feature would have any implications on accessibility.
                  Users already have to deal with content intermixed with other content (e.g. ads, sidebars,
                  etc). There's nothing particularly special about AT users here — visual users have
                  to deal with pages with mixed content too.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: It's just an opaque term. It could be called "bunny rabbits algorithm"
                  and the spec would have the same normative meaning. It's just a phrase used so that
                  one part of the spec can invoke text given elsewhere in the spec. I don't really understand
                  what a definition would be.

                  The second sentence is saying that nothing is editable unless the spec says so elsewhere.
                  (It says so for most of the input types under specific conditions, such as the condition

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: How else would one send coordinates? Creating a client-side image map with
                  a zillion 1x1 rects is hardly better for accessibility. Sometimes, a coordinate is
                  what is needed.
                  
                  I agree that it's not a good way of doing navigation, but then nobody's doing that
                  that way now anyway, so it's not a real problem. If you would like more non-normative
                  text in the spec about the matter I'm happy to add some, just let me know what to
                  say.

                  &gt; I'm having a hard time understanding how the UI would work for this in a color
                  &gt; picker.  If type=color is rendered as a text field, it would have a dropdown
                  &gt; for autocomplete, like any other text field.  But if it is rendered as a color
                  &gt; picker, what would the autocomplete look like?
                  
                  If I picked red last time, it could automatically show red selected rather than requiring
                  me to manually select it again.

                  &gt; I don't think that's quite the same and in any event that should be filed as a
                  &gt; different bug if you think it is.
                  
                  Well, unless explained, your thoughts about them being not quite the same are not
                  supporting your rationale. I am not interested in filing a bug as I was pointing out
                  the flaw in your rationale by providing an example of where you have dictated UI.
                  A MUST requirement that is currently violated by at least one browser. So a precedent
                  has been set. I would suggest that if you want the spec to not dictate UI, you should
                  file a bug.

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale:
                  
                  &gt; Aaron asks his web browser to display a list of the currently
                  &gt; active keyboard shortcuts. [...] it would do this by
                  &gt; enumerating the command elements and retrieving each one's accessKeyLabel
                  &gt; property. The user agent wants to make the list more useful [...] it cannot easily
                  &gt; parse the accessKeyLabel string, as it knows neither the names the user agent
                  &gt; will use for modifier keys (e.g. "Ctrl", "control", an arrow glyph, etc.) nor
                  &gt; what method will be use to concatenate them (e.g. "Ctrl+a", "Ctrl/A", "^A",
                  &gt; "A+Control", an arrow plus "A", etc., all of which may depend on the platform,
                  &gt; user agent, language, and/or locale).
                  
                  The user agent does know what names the user agent will use. It's itself.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Louis has a browser add-in that lets him specify a keyboard
                  &gt; input and it tells him what function or element that is currently mapped to.
                  &gt; The user enters a representation of a key or key combination as a text string
                  &gt; using a consistent format (e.g. "Ctrl+[") regardless of which platform it's
                  &gt; running on. To determine which command this is assigned to, it converts the
                  &gt; string into the automation-friendly equivalent defined by the HTML5 spec, and
                  &gt; compares that to the representation associated with each command recognized by
                  &gt; the browser (per 4.11.5 Commands).
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; An automation-friendly representation could either be a list of codes
                  &gt; representing keys and their modifiers (e.g. an integer representing the F5 key
                  &gt; along with a mask of bits representing Alt and Shift modification) or it could
                  &gt; be a string compounded from substrings that are language-, locale- and
                  &gt; platform-neutral (e.g. "Ctrl+A" for the combination of the "A" key and the
                  &gt; equivalent of the control key, even in environments where the latter is not
                  &gt; normally written as "Ctrl"). 
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Either format could either be returned by an element using a property analogous
                  &gt; to accessKeyLabel, or user agents could be required to provide a function to
                  &gt; convert the user-friendly string returned by accessKeyLabel into an
                  &gt; automation-friendly representation.
                  
                  This seems entirely possible. It's a UA implementation issue.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Issue: Are there cases where an accessibility aid may be able to interact with
                  &gt; with the DOM in order to query keybindings, yet still need to simulate the key
                  &gt; combination associated with a control or command rather than activating it
                  &gt; programmatically? This would certainly be useful for test automation, but are
                  &gt; there accessibility cases?
                  
                  ATs should just communicate to the UAs directly, not via the JS APIs. That makes no
                  sense.

                  Mia, I suggest that you add yourself to the CC list for each of those bugs. I will
                  be closing this bug out.
                  
                  (Also, I notice that several of the comments are not specific requests for changes
                  to the spec but instead general comments along the lines of, e.g., "work will need
                  to be done" or "research will need to be done". We don't normally raise spec bugs
                  for general comments like that, but instead only for comments that are actionable
                  by an editor. I went ahead and filed them in this case just for the sake of completeness.)
                  
                  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 13739 ***

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: The spec provides infrastructure for implementing what it calls "drag and
                  drop" using any input device that can specify a way to pick something, whether that
                  be a keyboard, a motion detector, a pose detector, a telepathic interface, a microphone,
                  or anything else. It's completely input-device independent.

                  The inclusion of this attribute would impose assumptions on the UI implementation
                  of a UA. 
                  
                  The ability for a UA to define system integration and interfaces is of greater importance
                  than the ability for an author to declare the mode of operation of such interfaces.
                  
                  Any UA issues will be raised directly.

                  &gt; Status: Rejected
                  &gt; Change Description: no spec change
                  &gt; Rationale: The paused-for-user-interaction state is for states where the video
                  &gt; is still technically playing (i.e. hitting "play" will not change anything).
                  &gt; When you hit a pause-on-exit cue, on the other hand, it does a real pause as if
                  &gt; the user hit the pause button (so hitting play would resume).
                  
                  So, the paused-for-user-interaction state is only used when, e.g. the video goes into
                  network buffering mode because it has no further data to play?
                  
                  I am wondering whether, when the screen reader asks the browser to pause with the
                  playback of a video and wait until a text cues has finished reading a description,
                  the UA should really continue to be in playing state and not throw the onpause event
                  and onplay event, because the pausing has been created by the UA internally. OTOH,
                  I guess the pause-on-exit cue does not have to be used for extended text descriptions
                  to enforce the "pausing" behaviour.

                  not make sense. The other type of colors supported is a legacy feature as comment
                  1 points out and authors cannot use it anymore. They have to use CSS, which supports
                  system colors.

                  I'm not even sure it's a CSS issue. CSS puts the content in the rendering tree exactly
                  like page content. If the UAs aren't reading it, that's a UA bug.

                  In brief:
                  
                  &gt; It is our understanding that the CSSWG defines pseudo-class selectors in its
                  &gt; modules, and the HTMLWG defines how elements enter the corresponding states in
                  &gt; HTML5. Given that understanding, this section seems to be missing normative
                  &gt; references to the appropriate specs, i.e. Selectors 3 / CSS3 UI / Selectors 4.
                  
                  The references are at the top of the section.
                  
                  
                  &gt; With regards to '':ltr'' and '':rtl'', these should be updated to '':dir()''
                  &gt; per Selectors 4: see http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=13346
                  
                  Done.
                  
                  
                  &gt; We've added '':past'' and '':future'' to the Selectors 4 draft for you, btw.
                  &gt; Next time please ask us if you need a selector defined. We might not get to it
                  &gt; right away, but at least we will be aware that we need to draft a spec for it.
                  
                  I think :past, :future, and ::cue() are better defined in the spec that needs them,
                  namely the WebVTT spec. (Just like, for example, the regions spec is the right place

                  &gt; The link to CSS2.1 [CSS] should be http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/, not the CSS
                  &gt; Snapshot page.
                  
                  It's intended to link to whatever is the most recent normative text for CSS, not CSS2.1
                  specifically.
                  
                  
                  &gt; The link to CSS Color Module Level 3 [CSSCOLOR] should be
                  &gt; http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/, not the development version.
                  
                  Where public development versions exist, they are preferred as they represent more
                  up to date text.
                  
                  
                  &gt; In the CSSWG, while Editor's Drafts are public, they are published at the sole
                  &gt; discretion of the document's editor and have not necessarily been reviewed or
                  &gt; approved by the CSSWG. Therefore they do not serve as official statements on
                  &gt; the state of the work being done by the CSSWG and should not serve as normative
                  &gt; references.
                  
                  They're not intended to be links to anything official, they're intended to be links
                  to the most useful information.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Section 4.8.2 describing the 'seamless' attribute attempts to specify the
                  &gt; sizing of seamless iframes, but it does so in an incomplete and somewhat
                  &gt; incorrect manner.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; This section should instead delegate to CSS, where we should define how this
                  &gt; sort of sizing works.
                  
                  Please elaborate on what is insufficient in a separate bug, or provide a URL to which
                  the spec can defer.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Chapter 10 says that it is not normative, but it says it in a rather roundabout
                  &gt; way. It would probably avoid confusion if it actually had the literal words
                  &gt; "informative" or "not normative" at the top.
                  
                  It is normative, ish. It is not non-normative. (Whether it is informative or not is
                  debatable, but that's a separate issue.)

                  An inportant use case is a row that spans the whole table.  Writing a routine that

                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: I concurr with Simon. In fact, I'd go even further. It's far more likely
                  that an author who has a single &lt;dl&gt; with first a &lt;dd&gt; and then a &lt;dt&gt; has accidentally
                  typoed the element names and meant for the &lt;dd&gt; to be a &lt;dt&gt; and the &lt;dt&gt; to be a
                  &lt;dd&gt;. As such, it's our responsibility to make it easy for validators to catch this.
                  
                  (In reply to comment #2)
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; Usecase is, for example, product title and its image and/or description in
                  &gt; product list (in online shops, on manufacturer's website, etc.). Such items are
                  &gt; often marked-up as DLs, while title of a product is often placed at the bottom
                  &gt; of the item, not at the top.
                  
                  I would recommend using &lt;figure&gt; for this.

                  Rationale: 
                  
                  This defeats the entire point of having a well-defined semantic language: there's
                  no fallback behaviour for legacy UAs or UAs that don't support the component model
                  / CSS / scripting / whatever it is that gives the elements their behaviour or styles.
                  For example, search engines wouldn't be able to determine how to process the files
                  that used these new features.

                  Rationale:
                  
                  Putting the link relation on the wiki page is sufficient to reserve it, but it also
                  has to be implemented to actually be of any use in the world (and that's a prerequisite
                  to being added to the spec, in principle).
                  
                  Discussion of this kind of thing is probably best done in one of the W3C lists such
                  as public-html or the voice-related working group mailing lists.

                  &gt; The "size" attribute however is needed as a rendering hint, and cannot always
                  &gt; be inferred correctly. It may need to be shorter than the maximum possible
                  &gt; value, for example if rendering a data table where horizontal space is at a
                  &gt; premium (this is the case that I'm looking at).
                  
                  If you're just worrying about the size from a presentation point of view, just use
                  CSS to set the width. That will be far more reliably than size="".
                  
                  
                  &gt; It might also want to be longer
                  &gt; than the maximum possible value, for example to match width of other fields in
                  &gt; the same form, for appearance purposes.
                  
                  Again, that seems like a job for CSS.
                  
                  
                  &gt; I suppose theoretically it could be sized using CSS, but surely if that's the
                  &gt; correct response there's no need for the "size" attribute anywhere?
                  
                  It's useful on &lt;input type=text&gt; to give the expected width of the input without actually
                  restricting the input length to that size. That doesn't apply to type=number since
                  the data type is known.
                  
                  
                  &gt; Firefox &amp; Chrome I believe both implement this anyway (Opera
                  &gt; does mis-render such fields, though).
                  
                  If the browsers already do it, that's a possible reason to change the spec. Firefox
                  doesn't implement type=number, though, so at most that's one browser, and it's still
                  new.
                  
                  
                  &gt; On "maxlength" again - this is very useful for backwards compatibility. Without
                  &gt; it, browsers that do not understand HTML 5 have no indication of maximum valid
                  &gt; length for entered values. I would suggest that instead of being disallowed,
                  &gt; the specification indicates it should be ignored by browsers that understand
                  &gt; "min", "max" &amp; "step" attributes.
                  
                  That's plausible, I guess, though a bit confusing, as it would mean we are allowing
                  an attribute that does nothing. Usually that's a sign of a mistake. If you think this
                  should be considered further, please file a separate bug for this issue.
