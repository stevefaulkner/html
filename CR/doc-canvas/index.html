                  More generally, if the editor has given a disposition and someone else wants to provide
                  new information in the future, it's correct for the bug to stay resolved in the meantime.
                  
                  For these reasons, I'm making the following changes:
                  
                  1) Moving bug back to RESOLVED/WORKSFORME
                  2) Adding TrackerIssue keyword
                  3) Moving to pre-LC component, since this is covered by a pre-LC issue resulting from
                  older bugs

                  &gt; This does not appear to have been addressed by the chairs. We have focus
                  &gt; rings functions but it would be valuable to have this addition to text
                  &gt; metrics in order to compute the path for drawing the focus rings. At one
                  &gt; point they had asked for additional information and it was provided.
                  &gt; 
                  &gt; http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/ChangeProposals/FocusRingTextBaseline
                  
                  The current textmetrics API returns a set of baselines.
                  Does this API not fulfill your use=case?

                  Status: Did Not Understand Request
                  Change Description: no spec change
                  Rationale: I'm going to add the ability to draw text to a path, which gives you some
                  more control. I'm not sure what specifically else should be added; text spacing is
                  the only other thing listed in this bug but you can fake that with just drawing each
                  character at a time if you're willing to lose kerning information. (We might want
                  to add kerning metrics to TextMetrics, file a separate bug if you want that.) In short,
                  I'm not really sure what to do here. See also comment 8.

                  to the 'transform' property.

                  way or another since we don't allow cross-origin fonts at all unless CORS is used.
                  So fixing our code to align with this change is a no-op.
                  
                  This seems to close the window when the door is already opened. As you point out,
                  you can get lots of information using CSSOM, and likely more as time goes on. Additionally,
                  using things like pointer-events and SVG filters, you can get the actual pixel data
                  in the font too.
                  
                  So the result of this bug seems to be solely to require implementations to add code.
                  No actual security or privacy improvements are archived.
                  
                  The only benefit I can see is if is there is a long term plan to close the other holes
                  too. Is that the case?

                  Rationale: I don't really see why this is a canvas problem and not a TrueType problem.
                  As far as Canvas goes, we don't define the anti-aliasing-level rendering detail, because
                  that would be insane and would preclude optimisations for specific display types.
                  If this makes for illegible text, please file bugs with the browsers.

                  &gt; Yeah, IDL [Clamp] does the right thing.  If the typed array spec is defined via
                  &gt; WebIDL, then we're probably all set.  (Though if it does, it needs various
                  &gt; verbiage about sets of supported indices and such that it seems to be missing.)
                  
                  Sorry for letting this go so long, but the editor's draft of the typed array spec
                  now defines the supported indexed properties. https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/#7

                  We have a hit testing proposal that includes paths that have been applied to canvas
                  under the section Hit Regions. This allows an author to route mouse events to fallback
                  content where the fallback element is bound to a closed path on canvas. Specifically,
                  the addHitRegion has a control argument which refers to a fallback content element
                  to which the events would be routed.

                  Rationale:
                  
                  The non-normative text says: "If the image has no image data, throws an INVALID_STATE_ERR
                  exception."
                  
                  The normative text says: "If the image argument is an HTMLCanvasElement object with
                  either a horizontal dimension or a vertical dimension equal to zero, then the implementation
                  must raise an INVALID_STATE_ERR exception."
                  
                  So I don't see the problem.  Please clarify.

                  &gt; Rationale: Marking closed per reporter.
                  
                  
                  The request is similar to the WHATWG proposed method scrollPathIntoView():
                  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#dom-context-2d-scrollpathintoview
                  
                  scrollPathIntoView() works with the current path. scrollIntoView(element) would work
                  with an element present in the Canvas subtree. This is already covered by CSSOM, we
                  simply need to improve UA handling of DOM elements in the Canvas subtree. That work
                  will likely move forward as development of Web Components (and the shadow tree) moves
                  forward.

               <p style="white-space: pre-wrap">                  Hi there,
                  
                  I was just wondering. From the Spec here: http://dev.w3.org/html5/2dcontext/#textmetrics
                  the TextMetrics object contains a readonly width property which is missing on the
                  whatwg wiki you linked to above: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Canvas#TextMetrics_-_DONE
                  That confuses me a little, is that property now dropped or are these sources only
                  out of sync?
                  
                  Thanks for the job guys.
